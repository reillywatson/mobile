The Subway[3.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Kramer </b> : All right, Coney Island.

<dl><dd> <b>  Jerry </b> : I'm saying that the spit could not have come from behind, that there had to have been a second spitter, behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claim, that would've caused your head to pitch forward.</dd><dd> <b>  Elaine </b> : So the spit could've only come from the front and to the right.</dd><dd> <b>  Jerry </b> : But that's not what they would have you believe.</dd><dd> <b>  Newman </b> : I'm leavin.'

The Wallet[4.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jerry </b> : Don't you hate "To be continued" on TV? It's horrible when you sense the "To be continued" coming. You know, you're watching the show; you're into the story. There's, like, five minutes left and suddenly you realize, "Hey, they can't make it. Timmy's still stuck in the cave. There's no way they wrap this up in five minutes." I mean, the whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends. If I want a long, boring story with no point to it, I have my life. A comedian can't do that, see. I can't go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig under his arm... Can you come back next week?"</dd></dl>
