I looked the other way when my wig-based parent company turned a bunch of children orange. I once claimed "I am God" during a deposition. <i>  [jump cut] </i> and... I may have sodomized our former Vice President while under the influence of some weapons-grade narcotics. <i>  [sighs] </i> It feels good to say that out loud actually.
