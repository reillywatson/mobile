The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis[4.2]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> How are we suppose to scale back our energy costs when you are filling this generator with gasoline?</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> Yeah bro, since when did you start running the bar on a gas generator?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlie: </b> About a week ago. I've been doing it for about a week.</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> Why would you do that?!</dd><dd> <b>  Charlie: </b> Well because you know electricity is so expensive man. So I figured let's get a generator and you know run the bar on it.</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> Are you kidding me?! Gasoline is like a thousand times more expensive than electricity!</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> You know what Charlie, you shouldn't be making these decisions anyway, okay? You're not the decision making type. As the brains of this organization, I should have made this decision.</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> Hey, whoa, whoa, I'm sorry. Since when did you become the brains?</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> Uhh...I'm sorry. I've always been the brains.</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> What?! What are you talking about? I thought I was the brains. What the hell am I?</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> You're the looks.</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> Well, yeah, of course I'm the looks, but I always thought of myself as the brains and the looks.</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> No, you're the looks, I'm the brains, and Charlie is the wildcard.

Look, every great crew in history has followed that basic dynamic, right? Looks, brains, wildcard. Think about it! The A-team did it. Scooby Doo did it. The Ghostbusters did it!</dd><dd> <b>  Charlie: </b> Oh shit!</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> Yes! Right? Our problem is that we don't stick to that basic format and it gets us in trouble.</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> So what you're saying is that by breaking from that format, we're actually limiting our ability to be as successful as those organizations.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlie: </b> You're totally right, dude.</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> Great, onto the matter at hand. We're getting plowed in the ass by the oil companies and the gas companies with their ten gallon hats and their rotten ass-plowing hearts. So, as the brains of this organization, I came up with a plan.</dd><dd> <b>  Dennis: </b> Lay it on us, bud.</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> It involves us pulling up our bootstraps, oiling up a couple of asses, and doing a little plowing of our own. <i>  [long pause] </i> Not gay sex.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlie: </b> Ah...okay, 'cause that's what it sounded like. What did you mean...</dd><dd> <b>  Mac: </b> We're gonna solve the gas crisis!</dd><dd> <b>  Charlie: </b> Oh, good!</dd></dl>
