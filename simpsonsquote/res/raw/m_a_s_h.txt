Picture This
<dl><dd> <b>  BJ </b> (about Charles): I'll bet he has the largest record collection in all of Korea. Maybe all of Asia. Probably the world. You know, you'd think a guy with that many records wouldn't have a chance to play them all, but he does. It can be done if you have your phonograph on for every minute of every day. And night! But I like it!</dd></dl>
Season 10
Picture This
<dl><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : I just wonder if I'm getting what this painting is really all about: the camaraderie, the affection we have for each other. Oh, I'm getting the bodies all right, but I wonder if I'm getting the souls. Maybe I bit off more than I can chew.</dd><dd> <b>  Klinger </b> : Uh, I have to go sir. (he leaves)</dd><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : Of course son. You know, you people have been closer than kinfolk to me, you make it almost bearable being over here.</dd><dd> <b>  Margaret </b> : Excuse me sir please. (she leaves)</dd><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : Surely. In a way, this painting is a way of sharing my Korean family with my family back home.</dd><dd> <b>  Mulcahy </b> : Of course. Of course. (he leaves leaving Potter at a table by himself)</dd><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : It ain't easy telling people how close you are to 'em when they aren't here.</dd></dl>

Season 11
Hey, Look Me Over

He bet someone that he could put a pool ball in his mouth and then take it out.</dd><dd> <b>  BJ </b> : Well, he was half right.</dd></dl>
Season 11
Trick or Treatment
<dl><dd> <b>  Hawkeye </b> : The way I see it, the Army owes us so many coffee breaks, we should get 1954 off.</dd></dl>

Foreign Affairs
<dl><dd> <b>  Major Reddish </b> : It's been getting harder and harder to sell this war to the folks back home.</dd><dd> <b>  Hawkeye </b> : Well, that's what happens when you spend everything on weapons and nothing on advertising.</dd><dd> <b>  Major Reddish </b> : Right.</dd></dl>

Season 11
Who Knew?
<dl><dd> <b>  BJ </b> : One sure test of good oatmeal is that you can't fill your fountain pen with it.</dd><dd> <b>  Mulcahy </b> : What the oatmeal lacks in solidity, the coffee more than makes up for.</dd><dd> <b>  Hawkeye </b> : When you haven't had much sleep, there's nothing like a good cup of coffee that you can really sink your teeth into.</dd></dl>
Season 11
Who Knew?
<dl><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : Now, can we get on with this? I have some meaningless trivial business that is far more important.</dd><dd> <b>  Klinger </b> : OK. I didn't want to take any chances so I hid our little product in a clever place. This is it. (holds up a hula hoop)</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : My word, you have invented the circle!</dd></dl>
Season 11
Bombshells
<dl><dd> <b>  Klinger </b> : Hey, guys. Did you know that Ted Williams is going home? I heard the Red Sox paid fifty thousand bucks to get him out of the Marines.</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : Boy, that's not what I heard. I heard it was seventy-five thousand and they sold Babe Ruth to the Navy.</dd></dl>
Season 11
Bombshells
<dl><dd> <b>  BJ </b> : We sit around here in our Hawaiian shirts and red suspenders, thumbing our nose at the Army, drinking home brewed gin and flouting authority at every turn, and feeling, oh, so superior to those military fools who kill each other and oh so self-righteous when we clean up after them. Well, good luck to you pal. I hope you can...keep it up. The minute I cut that rope, they made me a soldier.</dd></dl>
Season 11
Settling Debts
<dl><dd> (in Father Mulcahy's tent planning a mortgage burning party for Colonel Potter)</dd><dd> <b>  Margaret </b> : I think a party with a theme would be really cute.</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : Must we? Can't we just hand the poor man the mortgage, let him ignite it and go on about our business?</dd><dd> <b>  BJ </b> : There's an exciting theme: apathy. What time shouldn't we be here?</dd><dd> <b>  Klinger </b> : Aw, come on, Major. Didn't your folks do something special when they got their first house?</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : Yes. Yes they did. They fired the entire staff.</dd></dl>
Season 11
Settling Debts
<dl><dd> <b>  Hawkeye </b> : All right. Look, just for the sake of your sanity, I'll tell you this much. Mildred wants to surprise you.</dd><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : Surprise me?</dd><dd> <b>  Hawkeye </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : It ain't my birthday. That was last month. It ain't our anniversary. That's Groundhog Day. I picked it so I'd never forget it.</dd><dd> <b>  BJ </b> : Relax, you're gonna love it.</dd><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : That's the same thing she said when she put the leopard skin seat covers on the Hudson . Never felt safe getting in that car without a whip and a chair.</dd></dl>

And I would have been here sooner but I had to stop to accept the cheers of the entire audience.</dd></dl>

By the way, did I ever tell you about the time I was thrown out of the seminary dorm for snoring?</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : Uh...</dd><dd> <b>  Mulcahy </b> : The truth of the matter is you're not superior to any of us whether you snore or not.</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : Shh!</dd><dd> <b>  Mulcahy </b> : And at times like this, I'm not even sure you're equal.</dd></dl>

Can't you just say good morning as civilized people do?</dd><dd> <b>  Margaret </b> : (grunting and miming)</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : It is not my idea of breakfast fun to play charades.</dd><dd> <b>  Margaret </b> ; (more grunting)</dd><dd> <b>  Mulcahy </b> : Uh, Doctor, I believe you are being paged.</dd><dd> <b>  Margaret </b> : (more grunting and miming)</dd><dd> <b>  Charles </b> : My I at least finish my Wheaties?

He was just a guy like me, and I shot him and I killed him, for a pair of boots.</dd><dd> <b>  Potter </b> : You know, sometimes I think there should be a rule of war saying you have to see someone up close and get to know him before it's OK to shoot him.</dd><dd> <b>  Soldier </b> : How can I wear these again?

J. </b> : Whenever I smell month-old socks, I'll think of you.</dd><dd> <b>  Hawkeye </b> : Or the next time somebody nails my shoe to the floor...</dd><dd> <b>  B.
