Season 1
Talking to the Dead [1.01]
<dl><dd> [ <i>  First lines </i> ]</dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : [ <i>  Posing over a fake grave of Harry Houdini </i> ] Hey, Harry! Can you believe it? The same bullshit you so <i>  thoroughly </i> debunked almost a century ago is making a comeback. [ <i>  To camera </i> ] See? Anyone can talk to the dead! Now, getting an answer, that's the hard part.</dd><dd> <b>  Teller </b> : [ <i>  Through the plastic gravestone </i> ] Bullshit!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Talking to the Dead [1.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : [ <i>  Penn explains why there is so much vulgarity on the show </i> ] You'll notice much more obscenity than we usually use. That's not just because it's on Showtime, and we want to get some attention. It's also a legal matter. If one calls people liars and quacks, one can be sued and lose a lot of one's money. But "motherfuckers" and "assholes" is pretty safe. If we said it was all scams, we could also be in trouble. But BULLSHIT, oddly, is safe. So forgive all the bullshit language. We're trying to talk about the truth without spending the rest of our lives in court because of litigious motherfuckers!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Talking to the Dead [1.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Before we bust up this party- and god dammit we're gonna bust it up- we have to make it very clear where our hearts are. We have nothing but empathy for the people who are experiencing the loss and grief of the death of a loved one. That guy who lost his mom rips my heart out. I'm a momma's boy whose mom died a couple of years ago, and I'll never get over it, and my dad died at around the same time, and I was very close to both of them. I loved them so much there isn't a moment that goes by that I don't miss them. Houdini didn't really go nuts busting these mediums until he lost his mom. Once you've felt that pure grief, seeing it exploited can take away your sense of humor. Once a loved one has died, all we have is our memories of them. There is nothing more precious to me than my memories of my mom and dad. We don't give a rat's ass about the money these bastards are taking from the grief stricken; what we do care about deeply is the desecration of memories. These "performance artists" are, in a very real sense, mother-fuckers. That poor guy's grieving memories of his mother are now all fucked up by somebody else's images. All he will ever have left of his mom are memories, and this pig has pissed on those for a buck and a little un-earned fame. I'm sure these lame fucks tell themselves that they're easing the grief, but skits for money can not replace loving memories. How low do you have to be to exploit someone's true grief to sell some bullshit book?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Talking to the Dead [1.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : One of the weird things Houdini discovered is that some of these mediums actually slip into believing their own bullshit. They forget their own misses, or as John Edward, <i>  the Biggest Douche in the Universe </i> , does, rewrite them as hits that we're just not able to recognize. Cold reading can be done accidentally. That doesn't mean the psychic is a better person. Lying to themselves does not make lying to others OK. It can make intellectually lazy scumbags more convincing and dangerous. But even if these fucks <i>  know </i> they're just making this shit up and pushing people's buttons, they tell themselves, "At least I'm comforting the bereaved." Who the <i>  fuck </i> are they to decide that lying about the universe and a dead loved one is what the bereaved <i>  needs </i> !? That's condescending <i>  bullshit </i> !</dd></dl>

Season 1
Alternative Medicine [1.02]

He's talking about 2002 [ <i>  which had passed </i> ]. You can start breathing again!</dd><dd> [ <i>  Bruce Beech laughs hysterically </i> ]</dd></dl>
Season 1
End of the World [1.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : You know, when you hear about people predicting the end of the world...they're always predicting 60 to 90&#160;% of the world's population is going to get killed. It's odd how they're always planning on what they're gonna do when everyone else is dead. Teller and I have always played the odds, so, we're betting we're gonna die. You should see our credit card bills. They're higher than our cholesterol! Good thing we don't plan on paying 'em! [ <i>  microphone appears </i> ] I'm sure that we...</dd><dd> <b>  Cameraman </b> : Cut! Cut. The mike was in the shot.

End of the World [1.04]
<dl><dd> [ <i>  on the subject of decoding Nostradamus' writings </i> ]</dd><dd> <b>  John Hogue </b> : Quatrain 97 of century, Volume 6 reads, "At 45 degrees latitude, the sky will burn. Fire approaches the great New City." At latitude 45 degrees the only new city since Nostradamus' time that you could call great and new and vast is the city that rests between 40 degrees and 41 degrees latitude, which is Manhattan and New York. Now...that's a little off.</dd><dd> <b>  James Randi </b> : Then, he's way off in Canada or some place. When [Nostradamus] said 'New City', he was referring to Naples [Italy]. He refers to it several times throughout his writings and makes it clear that he's talking about Naples. <i>  Not </i> New York City.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Feng Shui/Bottled Water [1.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : [ <i>  on the subject of bottled water </i> ] Consumers are offered water with names conveying pure and pristine water sources. Ever hear of Alaskan Falls water? That must come from the crystal-clear glacial waters of our 49th state, right? Sorry, folks. Alaskan flows from this liqui-box corporation building in Worthington, Ohio. Does the brand Yosemite conjure up visions of the cool, pristine waters rushing through California's high sierras? Well, then the marketers have done their jobs. The source of Yosemite bottled water is actually 400 miles away in Northwest Los Angeles. How about Everest Water? Could our piddly show possibly afford to send a camera crew to Nepal? NOT NECESSARY. Everest comes from the industrial section of Corpus Cristi, Texas! In fact if you read the fine print on the FUCKING LABEL, they even admit that the water comes from a MUNICIPAL SOURCE! THAT IS TAP WATER, brothers and sisters of the cult of the bottle!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Feng Shui/Bottled Water [1.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : In much of the rest of the world, [drinking] tap water equals rapid and severe weight loss, with the introduction of new, probably harmful, friends to your intestines and other organs. Are we so ashamed of our wonderful tap water, that we have to disguise it?</dd></dl>

ESP [1.10]

I can tell you what your pet psychic is thinking and feeling. Your pet psychic is thinking "This is safe. No one can contradict me and realize I'm lying. I don't even have the balls to be a human psychic. I feel like such a pile of bullshit!"</dd></dl>
Season 1
Eat This! [1.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : When he <i>  (  Norman Borlaug  ) </i> won the Nobel Prize in 1970, they said he had saved a <i>  billion </i> people. That's BILLION. "BUH!" That's Carl Sagan billion with a "B". And most of them were of different race from him. Norman is the greatest human being. And you've probably never heard of him.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Eat This! [1.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Why is anyone fighting food advance? A very small percentage of the world's population is fortunate to have the luxury of turning down food. The rest of the world spends most of its time trying to get <i>  any </i> food. [...] We need to spread all the technology all we can, so all people everywhere can deal with the problem of "too <i>  much </i> food". We can't start getting picky because <i>  we've </i> got enough food- that's just <i>  self-centered </i> and <i>  racist </i> . Unless you and yours are starving, YOU need to <i>  SHUT - THE FUCK - UP </i> !</dd></dl>
Season 1
Eat This! [1.11]

P.E.T.A. [2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : We're not gonna tease or abuse the bull. He doesn't have a cute name like Elsie, or Moo-Moo, or Heiferlips. His name is Dave. Nothing funny about that.

Season 2
P.E.T.A. [2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Ethical means <b>  moral </b> or <b>  proper </b> which differs for every person, it's something to discuss. It's not an absolute. It just sounds nice, it's like 'pro-choice' and 'pro-life', I mean- c'mon! Everyone is pro-choice <i>  and </i> pro-life. It's for or against <i>  abortion </i> that your group is about. And who <i>  wouldn't </i> wanna treat animals ethically, anyway. Nobody gets off slapping their monkey or choking their chicken or roughing up their clam.</dd></dl>
Season 2
P.E.T.A. [2.01]

Season 2
P.E.T.A. [2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : The PETA you don't know would outlaw fishing, circuses, dog shows, horseback riding and zoos. They even oppose using service animals like eye-dogs for the blind. Fucking blind bastards torturing those dogs! In PETA, there's no room for Kentucky Fried Chicken, or the Kentucky Derby. See you, Shamu! And forget about smearing honey all over your fuck buddy, because even bees are persecuted by the man. And pets are forbidden in PETA's world too. That's right! No pets. Hey all you pet lovers who donate to PETA, feel like a sucker yet?</dd></dl>
Season 2
P.E.T.A. [2.01]
<dl><dd> <i>  [On PETA's usage of Holocaust footage for its campaigns]. </i></dd><dd> <b>  Dennis Prager </b> : We have a generation here in America, of young people, who don't know what evil is [ <i>  cf. generations past </i> ]. They've never suffered. They don't know Nazism. They don't know Communism. They don't know torture, concentration camps, or death squads. And so they're so naive, that they think the worst evil is done to animals and the environment.</dd></dl>
Season 2
War on Drugs [2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : <i>  [Teller shows a pan] </i> This is drugs. <i>  [Teller shows some eggs, with the description of several types of civil liberties written on them] </i> These are your liberties. <i>  [cut to Penn on a steamroller] </i> AND THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT.</dd><dd> <i>  [Penn runs a steamroller ("the government") over the pan ("drugs") and the eggs ("civil liberties"), crushing them.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Any questions?</dd></dl>

Season 2
The Bible: Fact or Fiction? [2.06]

Season 2
The Bible: Fact or Fiction? [2.06]

<dl><dd> <b>  Eric Hoffschmidt </b> : My first reaction to Flight 93, was that the Military, after the towers had been hit, said "Uh-oh...wait a minute. That's not part of the plan! What is <i>  that </i> plane gonna do? Shoot it!"</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conspiracy Theories [3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jimmy Walter </b> : I firmly believe that most of the alleged passengers on the alleged hijacked planes are still alive and quite frankly, I think they were all probably working for the government.</dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Fuck you!

Conspiracy Theories [3.03]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Penn &amp; Teller are mocking the Moon Landing Hoax Conspiracy on a stage set w/ Penn as director] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : CUT! Jesus fucking Christ, Neil!

Ooh yeah, let's use <i>  real </i> pilots. I wanna use real pilots! [ <i>  to the camera </i> ] Faking the Moon Landing is easy. You need dirt, wardrobe, a sound stage, a lot of black paints, and some stupid suits. The hard part is shutting people up. It's been 36 years! You'd think the technicians, and prop people, camera people, directors, everyone who works at NASA, and the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, and all the nice folks at Cape Carnaval in Florida, plus members of the US Congress and the White House all shut up about this amazing cover-up for all that time? The Government couldn't even fucking cover up a break-in to a psychiatrist's office in a fucking cheesy hotel! Watergate is the answer to all this shit. If they couldn't cover that up, they fucking can't do anything.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conspiracy Theories [3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Clyde Lewis </b> : Do you really think that one morning in November, 1963, Lee Oswald just got up and said "I'm gonna shoot the President today"?</dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Yes, but that's not a very sexy answer!</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conspiracy Theories [3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : If the conspiracy [ <i>  to kill President Kennedy </i> ] is so big and evil, why hasn't it killed Jim [Marrs]? And how did crazy Oliver Stone's movie [ <i>  JFK (1991) </i> ] ever come out?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conspiracy Theories [3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Vincent Bugliosi </b> : Instinctively, people find it incongruous that this could all happen as the result of the coincidental meeting of the President and a lone nut. They feel that a greater conspiracy has to be involved.</dd></dl>

College [3.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : We're <i>  all </i> offended, all the time, and we don't have a fucking right <i>  not </i> to be offended! A free country is a marketplace of ideas, and college should be <i>  more </i> free, not less.</dd></dl>
Season 3
College [3.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Americans believe everybody deserves freedom to move up in the world. That's a great thing. But if moving up means spending four years in a beer commercial run by politeness police, maybe you should think twice.</dd></dl>

College [3.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Alan Kors </b> : What unversities are saying by these codes, special protections and double standards to women, to blacks, to hispanics, to gay and lesbian students, is: "You are too weak to live with freedom.

What do we have to give in return?</dd><dd> <i>  [cut to penn and teller] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : We have to give the government more power, but what power? The patriot act is "an act to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world, to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools, and for other purposes". Other purposes? What the fuck is that all about? Other purposes. You shouldn't even allow that kind of loose language in a fucking gym membership contract.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Boy Scouts [4.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : You'd think our Bullshit! experiment would settle the whole "gay" thing. But then there's <i>  this </i> asshole!</dd><dd> <b>  Hans Zyger </b> : As the homosexual movement became much more entrenched into American culture starting in the late 60's...it really became an opportunity for pedophiles to make a mass assault on the Boy Scouts.</dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Fuck you in the neck, mother fucker!</dd></dl>

Manners [4.08]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Teller entertains dinner guests with a floating bread roll trick while Penn continues.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Manners are habits we can cultivate to help us remain considerate of others, even when we're not thinking about it.

<dl><dd> <b>  Gloria </b> : If you're in a restaurant with a tablecloth, you do not eat a hamburger with your fingers. Rather, you take your knife, cut it in half, and eat one half.</dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : (voice over) Have some self respect Gloria. If the chef at this world-class restaurant thought his hamburger would be better eaten in halves, he would have <i>  cut the fucking sandwich himself!!

Season 4
Abstinence [4.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Today, a disturbing 35% of our school districts require that abstinence be taught as the <i>  only </i> option for teens. Even worse, these programs prohibit the discussion of contraception, unless it's about that <i>  stupid </i> small percentage of time when it doesn't work. Fuck! When did Washington turn into the Vatican?</dd></dl>
Season 4
Abstinence [4.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : So what have we learned? The U.S. government continues to dump hundreds of millions of our dollars a year into misleading, religion-based, anti-sex education. The only good thing about the program? It doesn't work. Most kids just ignore it. Sure, we're throwing away <i>  money </i> , but only really religious kids are hurt by it. Our religion-based government can't fuck us up on this because bullshit detection is written into our genes. The sex switch gets turned on at puberty, and no matter how much government or religion twists the truth, they're fighting the honest beauty of love and sex. That's like bringing a knife to a gun fight.</dd></dl>

Obesity [5.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : You know, our pal Marvin Minsky , pioneer of Artificial Intelligence at MIT, says: "I don't work out because we don't know yet enough about the long-term effects. It appears that each hour of exercise may add two hours to one's life - but I don't know of any evidence that this leads to getting better ideas."</dd></dl>
Season 5
Wal-Mart [5.02]
<dl><dd> <i>  [A hippie scene, while Teller is painting a Wal-Mart vest on a woman's otherwise bared torso] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Now hold on, this isn't some Wal-Mart lovefest. Sometimes, they're really assholes. In 2000, Wal-Mart reportedly paid $50 million to settle a lawsuit filed in Colorado by 69,000 workers who had been forced to work off the clock. In December 2005, Wal-Mart had to pay $172 million to 116,000 California employees for not giving them their legally-mandated 30-minute lunch breaks. So that's at least, uhh... 185,000 people who had a legitimate beef. And, uhh...don't spread it around, but I'm kinda-sort've a Target guy myself.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [After hearing a colonic irrigation "therapist" say that a colonic irrigation treatment cleans out junk that lodges in a subject's colon] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : That's bullshit.

It's as easy as that.</dd></dl>

That's what the americans with disabilities act says it's gonna do. What the fucking fuck? What is wrong with us? Have we all gone fucking crazy? We think the government is so good at what it does, the war on drugs, the war on poverty, the war on war. The government is so fucking good at that, they can fucking do anything? They can make us all physically equal, they can heal the lame, they can make the fucking blind fucking see!

Video Games [7.03]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Teller, wearing a high school letter jacket, plays on a computer while a group of students and cheerleaders cheer him on.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penn </b> : Next time you feel like worrying about fake violent video games, try a little Gedanken experiment: imagine that video games were invented 100 years <i>  before </i> football. Picture school video game teams and uniforms and hot-ass cheerleaders with big, bouncing pom-poms. Now imagine after 100 years of extracurricular video game fun, <i>  football </i> is invented and introduced to schools. Thousands of kids get real, no kidding, no fantasy, no make-believe broken knees, legs, ankles, cervical trauma, heatstroke, and concussions! <i>  [Throughout Penn's injury list, the crowd quiets, eventually becoming totally silent.] </i> ...What would parents do? From 1931 to 2007, 665 kids <i>  died </i> ... from injuries they suffered playing football. This is not video game violence - this is <i>  real </i> violence done to <i>  real </i> children by other real children, all encouraged by schools and society. Every parent worries about his or her kids; every adult worries about all children, but you need to pick what you think is worth worrying about.</dd></dl>
