We turn to the rest of the house of vampires and say, 'oops, sorry.'</dd><dd> <b>  Elena </b> : I can't believe you made a deal with her?</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : It was more like a helpful exchange of information. It's not like I had a choice. She's... scary. Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back.</dd><dd> <b>  Elena </b> : Of course she is. Damon gets what he wants, as usual, no matter who he hurts in the process.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : Well, you don't have to be snarky about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Elena </b> : I woke up this morning to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb. I've earned snarky.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : Ah... How long are you going to blame me for turning your birth mother in to a vampire?</dd><dd> <b>  Elena </b> : I'm not blaming you, Damon. I've accepted the fact that you're a self serving psychopath with no redeeming qualities.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : Ouch.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : This isn't being very productive. We're gonna figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires, yeah?</dd><dd> <b>  Elena </b> : I'm sorry. He just makes me so cranky.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : I know...

Just like Vicki, who I haven't heard from since she left.</dd><dd> <b>  Caroline </b> : Well, you can't control your mom, Matt, any more than you can control your sister.</dd><dd> <b>  Matt </b> : I wish that she would just try, a little, you know. If she would just try to try, that would be okay.</dd><dd> <b>  Caroline </b> : Maybe she'll surprise you. People have a tendency to do that. I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm.</dd><dd> <b>  Matt </b> : Are you sure that you should be driving right now?</dd><dd> <b>  Caroline </b> : I have to - it's my dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday.

I don't think so.</dd><dd> <b>  Jeremy </b> : You should turn me 'cause I don't have anything else.</dd><dd> <b>  Anna </b> : Do you even know why we turn other people? It's not just to give someone a one way ticket out of lonerhood, okay? One, we need someone to do our dirty work. Two, revenge. Three, boredom, but you know that never turns out well. And then, you know, there's the obvious one - you love someone so much that you would do anything to spend all of eternity with them.

Just drink, already. Come on. This self-detox is not natural.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : Could you get that away from me, please?</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : How long did it take you to wean yourself off of it after you last indulged? <i>  [Stefan doesn't answer] </i> That's not good.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : I'll be fine. It just takes a little bit of time.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : I don't get it. You know you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for. I haven't hunted a human in... God, way too long.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : Oh, I'm impressed.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : It's completely self serving, trying to get the town off the trail of vampires. Which is not very easy, considering there's an entire tomb of them running around.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : What are we planning on doing about that?</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : You're not gonna be doing much of anything if you don't have your strength - there's nothing wrong with partaking in a healthy diet of human blood from a blood bank. You're not actually killing anyone.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : I have my reasons.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : Well, what are those holier than thou reasons, because, you know, we've never actually discussed that. You know, I'd love to hear this story.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Just watching me struggle.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : Very much so.</dd><dd> <b>  Stefan </b> : I hate to break it to you, Damon, but I actually have it under complete control.</dd><dd> <b>  Damon </b> : You do? Oh, well, then you should just carry on making the rest of us vampires look bad.
