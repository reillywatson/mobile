<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: We had such a fantastic connection. Then he leaves me money. I don't understand. What exactly about me screams "whore"?</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Besides the thousand dollars on the end table?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> <i>  [seeing Mr. Big leaving church with his mother] </i> &#160;: There he was, wearing Armani on a Sunday: Mr. Big. I'll admit it was a bit of a shock. Up until that moment I thought he only believed in the Yankees.</dd></dl>

It's one of the best on the east side!</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: What, are you rating churches? Is there a Zagat guide for that?</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Four stars.

<dl><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: That can be a turn-on.</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Sure, but now he wants me to reciprocate and I can't. I never could.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Why not?</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Because sex is not a time to chat. In fact, it's one of the few instances in my overly articulated, exceedingly verbal life where it is perfectly appropriate -- if not preferable -- to shut up. And now suddenly I have to worry about being stumped for conversation? -- no thank you.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: Just keep talking about his big cock.</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: Correction -- his big, beautiful cock.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: We're using the C-word now?</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: I can't use adjectives</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Freak Show
<dl><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: I'm sorry, if a man is over thirty and single, there's something wrong with him. It's Darwinian.

<dl><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> <i>  [looks at watch] </i> : I have to go feed my cat.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> <i>  [voiceover] </i> : Miranda had invoked our code phrase, honed over years of bad parties, awful dates and phone calls that wouldn't end. Unfortunately, I wasn't ready to accept defeat. <i>  [out loud] </i> I thought you already fed your cat.</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: I have to feed it again.</dd><dd> <b>  Manhattan Guy </b> &#160;: Cat people are freaks.</dd></dl>

Season 2(1999)
Four Women and a Funeral
<dl><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: Everyone needs a man. That's why I rent. If you own and he still rents, then the power structure is all off. It's emasculating.

Season 2(1999)
Four Women and a Funeral

Season 2(1999)
The Cheating Curve
<dl><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: Nobody told me it was BYO man!</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Well, what did you expect? It's a lesbian art show.</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: I know! But don't straight guys usually follow them around to see what they're going to do?</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Cheating Curve
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Well, I think maybe there's a cheating curve. That someone's definition of what constitutes cheating is in direct proportion to how much they themselves want to cheat.</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: That's moral relativism !</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: I prefer to think of it as quantum cheating.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Chicken Dance
<dl><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: I just don't understand. How could you forget someone you slept with?</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Toto, I don't think we're in single digits anymore.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Chicken Dance
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Are you sure you can leave the Guest Book unattended?</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Its a bullshit job, Carrie. People know what to do with the guestbook.</dd></dl>

Old Dogs, New Dicks
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: You've never seen an uncircumsized one?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: I'm from Connecticut!</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Old Dogs, New Dicks
<dl><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: If 85% [of men] aren't circumsized, that means I've only slept with 15% of the population, tops.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Wow, you're practically a virgin!</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Caste System
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Now I've laid down a gauntlet. He either has to say "I love you" back or I guess I'm going to have to break up with him.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: Well, how long are you going to give him?</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Well, I didn't put an expiration date on the sentiment, but I figure it's got the shelf life of a dairy product. It's going to start to curdle in about a week.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Caste System
<dl><dd> <b>  Steve </b> &#160;: What's wrong with corduroy?</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: I don't have enough time to tell you what's wrong with corduroy.</dd></dl>

Evolution
<dl><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: I never leave underwear at a guy's place because I never see it again.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: What happens to it?</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: Nothing; I just never go back.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Doesn't that get a little expensive, disposing of lingerie every time you sleep with a guy?</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: That's why I stopped wearing underwear on dates.</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: And that's why I'm never borrowing a dress from you again.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Evolution
<dl><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: I am so confused. Is he gay or is he straight?</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Well, it's not that simple anymore. The real question is, is he a straight gay man or is he a gay straight man?</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> <i>  [voiceover] </i> &#160;: The gay straight man was a new strain of heterosexual male spawned in Manhattan as the result of overexposure to fashion, exotic cuisine, musical theatre and antique furniture.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
La Douleur Exquise!
<dl><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> <i>  [about a waiter dressed in a bondage outfit] </i> &#160;: How does he wait on tables dressed like that? It's humiliating.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Well, the summer I worked at Howard Johnson's I had to wear an orange hat.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
La Douleur Exquise!
<dl><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> <i>  [to Charlotte] </i> &#160;: I wonder what your fetish is.</dd><dd> <b>  Stanford </b> &#160;: Charlotte has a thing for Crabtree &amp; Evelyn potpourri.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
La Douleur Exquise!
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: After we made love I knew it was over. Did I ever really love Big or was I addicted to the pain? The exquisite pain of wanting someone so unattainable?</dd><dd> <b>  Big </b> &#160;: Come to bed.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: I wanted to go to him, but I felt like I was tied to the chair. Some part of me was holding me back, knew I'd reached my limit. And just like that, I united myself from Mr. Big, I was free, but there was nothing exquisite about it.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Games People Play
<dl><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: The only place you can control a man is in bed. If we perpetually gave men blow jobs we could run the world!</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: And at least our hands would be free to greet dignitaries and stuff.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Games People Play
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> : <i>  [about therapists] </i> First they want you to come there two times a week, then three times a week, and eventually you're starting every sentence with 'my therapist says...'</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> : My therapist says that's a very common fear.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Fuck Buddy
<dl><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: Carrie, you can't date your fuck buddy.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Say it a little louder, I don't think the old lady in the last row heard you.</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: You're going to take the only person in your life that's there purely for sex, no strings attached, and turn him into a human being? Why?</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
The Fuck Buddy
<dl><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: You double-booked?</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: How do you conceive pulling this one off?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: Early dinner with bachelor number one, late supper with bachelor number two.</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: My god, you're turning into a man!</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> <i>  [voiceover] </i> &#160;: Apparently Charlotte had done more than just break a pattern. She had actually changed genders.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: I just don't know how I'm going to eat two dinners in a row.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> <i>  [voiceover] </i> &#160;: And just like that, she was a woman again.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Shortcomings
<dl><dd> <b>  Duncan </b> &#160;: I'm just one of those weird male aberrations who prefers to be married. I like stability, I like routine. I like knowing there's people waiting for me at home. I guess that makes me sound pretty dull.</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Are you kidding? You're the heterosexual holy grail.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Was It Good For You?
<dl><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: I'm trying to change my bed karma. I figure if I can make my bed a place I really want to be, others will feel the same.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Aah, the Field of Dreams.</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Exactly. If you build it, he will come.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Was It Good For You?
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> <i>  [about her date who wouldn't kiss her] </i> &#160;: I couldn't figure it out. I knew he wanted me because during my lean-in-and-kiss-me-good-night move, I accidentally on purpose felt his pop-up-and-say-hello.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Twenty-Something Girls vs. Thirty-Something Women
<dl><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: It's a really cute three bedroom cottage and they're giving us a fantastic deal for the month of August.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Yeah, of course it's a good deal. It's haunted with cheating boyfriends and sexual rejection.</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: We could always burn sage.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Twenty-Something Girls vs. Thirty-Something Women
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: And then I realized something, twenty-something girls are just fabulous, until you see one with the man who broke your heart.</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Ex and the City
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: There is no way that the love that I had with Big is the same thing that he has with Natasha.</dd><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: "Natasha"? When did you stop calling her "the idiot stick figure with no soul"?</dd></dl>
Season 2(1999)
Ex and the City
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Then I had a thought: maybe I didn't break Big. Maybe the problem was he couldn't break me. Maybe some women aren't meant to be tamed. Maybe they need to run free, until they find someone just as wild to run with.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2000)
Where There's Smoke
<dl><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: What is it about fireman, even when they aren't that cute, they're cute... ya know?!</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: Its that whole hero complex</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: And then there's the weight restriction</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> &#160;: Its because women just really want to be rescued.</dd></dl>

Season 3 (2000)
Politically Erect
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: I figured we made a good match. I was adept at fashion; he was adept at politics. And really, what's the difference? They're both about recycling shop-worn ideas and making them seem fresh and inspiring.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2000)
Politically Erect
<dl><dd> <b>  Stanford </b> &#160;: I can only stay a few minutes. I got tickets to the Vagina Monologues.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Stanford </b> &#160;: Just because I don't eat at the restaurant doesn't mean I can't hear the specials.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2000)
Attack of the Five Foot Ten Woman
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: There are very few things this New Yorker loves as much as Sunday brunch. You can sleep until noon and still get eggs anywhere in the city, alcohol is often included with the meal, and Sunday is the one day a week you get the single woman's sports pages: the New York Times wedding section.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2000)
Attack of the Five Foot Ten Woman

Race is a very big issue.</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> : No, there is no reason to bring race into this. Chivon is a sweet man. We have great sex--and he happens to have the <i>  biggest </i> --</dd><dd> <b>  Charlotte </b> : <i>  [interrupts loudly] </i> --black cock! We know! He has a big black cock!</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> : I was about to say "biggest heart"...now that you're so interested, yes. He does have a big black cock. <i>  [smiles contently] </i></dd></dl>

Season 3 (2000)
Are We Sluts?
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Wow! It's like a Danielle Steele novel in here!</dd><dd> <b>  Aidan </b> &#160;: From a writer, I'm pretty sure that's an insult.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2000)
Drama Queens
<dl><dd> <b>  Miranda </b> &#160;: Steve is completely predictable but that's one of the things I love about him. He's just so comfortable and safe.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> &#160;: Are you dating a man or a minivan?</dd><dd> <b>  Samantha </b> &#160;: Your relationship is my greatest fear.</dd></dl>
