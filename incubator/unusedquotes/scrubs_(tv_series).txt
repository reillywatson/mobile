<dl><dd> <b>  Turk </b> : Oh, come on, Carla, give me one good reason why you won't go out with me.</dd><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : Well, you're a surgeon.

And you, you neurotic, one-woman freak-show, take your blah-blah to the blah-blah-ologist. Because if you are so stupid as to confront the <i>  Chief of Medicine </i> over some quasi-offensive endearment, then you've just got to go ahead and replace the captain of your brainship, because he's drunk at the wheel!</dd><dd> <b>  Elliot </b> : So, you're telling me I have to pick my battles.

My Bed Banter &amp; Beyond[1.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : Why did I become a doctor? Well, I guess it's because I've always wanted to help people.

Season 1
My Bed Banter &amp; Beyond[1.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : Relationships don't work the way they do on television and in the movies. Will they? Won't they? And then they finally do, and they're happy forever. Gimme a break. Nine out of ten of them end because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half of the ones who get married get divorced anyway, and I'm telling you right now, through all this stuff I have not become a cynic. I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate covered candies and, y'know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, because I do believe in it. Bottom line is: it's couples who are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but the big difference is they don't let it take them down. One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time. If it's right, and they're real lucky, one of them will say something.</dd></dl>

Season 1
My Student[1.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  J.D. </b> : <i>  [narration] </i> It's hard trying to figure out how to reach somebody. I guess the only thing to do is to think of someone that I look up to and remember how they first got through to me.</dd><dd> <i>  [Dr. Cox coming around the corner, approaches J.D.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : Newbie, the only way you could be less productive right now is if you were in fact, the wall on which you're leaning against. Of course, then you'd be providing some jackass with a wall on which to lean against and reflect on what a jackass he truly is. I know, here it's a conundrum, but don't you worry about it. I'll tackle that one right upstairs <i>  [points to his head] </i> . In the meantime, you could at least pretend to be doing some work. And right about now, even though you don't have your basket, oh it's just a terrific time for you to skip away, Shirley.</dd><dd> <i>  [J.D. walks away slowly] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : Skip away, skip away, skip away <i>  [J.D. skips a little] </i> , skip, skip, skip to my lou, whoo hoo!</dd></dl>

Season 1
My Tuscaloosa Heart[1.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Turk </b> : Sir, what happened to Bunny? We gotta know.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Kelso </b> : Well, actually, the music came before Bunny. I learned to play the guitar growing up as a young rapscallion in Mississippi, but things didn't really take off until I moved to Memphis. Then, I met the Colonel, and the hits just kept on comin'! Unfortunately, it went to my head. I gained a lot of weight, wore a white jumpsuit, and ate tranquilizers like they were trail mix.</dd><dd> <b>  Elliot </b> : Sir...</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Kelso </b> : Then in 1977 I died on the toilet... <i>  or did I? </i></dd><dd> <b>  Turk </b> : You never played the guitar, did you?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Kelso </b> : Son, that crap is for hippies!

And transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.</dd><dd> <b>  J.D. </b> : I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : Okaaay, that was my mistake. Here I engaged you, and gave you the impression that I actually cared, which is just <i>  so </i> wrong, God!</dd><dd> <b>  J.D. </b> : The thing is I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : Well, you definitely need something. Um, maybe a backbone. Or perhaps some testicles. At the very least, a pillow that you can carry around the hospital and cry your sad eyes out.</dd><dd> <b>  J.D. </b> : <i>  [To patient, who has been listening to the conversation] </i> I have testicles.

<dl><dd> <b>  J.D. </b> : I think you won't face Ben because you're afraid.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : I think you're right. I do. Partly because you've really gotten to know me this year, but mostly it's because well...I told you I was afraid earlier today. So please don't tell me you've come here to reiterate something I've already said. I already know the things I've said. In fact... I'm the one who said them.</dd></dl>

My Last Day[1.24]

My T.C.W.[2.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  J.D. </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I don't think people are meant to be by themselves.

For instance, I don't know that much about your home life other than the fact that you treat your wife like a dog, your dog like a wife, and your son like an androgynous ne'er-do-well who drained your retirement nest egg to open up a yarn shop in Minneapolis.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Kelso </b> : Harrison posted his first profit this quarter.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : Aces.

You see, the woman is <i>  everywhere </i> . She's there when I work out in the morning, when I work out in the car on the way to work, and when I work out when I get to work. I can't seem to get away from her. That used to be fine, when she just came by for five minutes every month or so to feed on my dignity, but now I'd honestly kill myself, Bob, if I weren't absolutely certain that Jordan would be waiting for me in the afterlife. You see, typical of her, she went ahead and signed us up for an eternal tandem bike ride all along the banks of the River Styx.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Kelso </b> : I'm so glad you shared.</dd></dl>

Oh, and if you see that neighbor Lena from down the hall I want you to roll your eyes and say the word "slut" under your breath, but loud enough so she can hear, and don't forget to be home by 6:30 because you gotta give Jack his bath before you make my dinner!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cox </b> : But, when will I have time to kill myself?</dd><dd> <b>  Jordan </b> : Well, that's not my problem!</dd></dl>

Season 8
My Full Moon[8.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Elliot </b> : <i>  [To Turk] </i> You know, I never answered your question earlier about whether you and I will always be doctors: you will. You have this amazing ability to find joy in everything you do. Whether it's an operation you've done a hundred times, or even teaching. But as for me, I know you think it was a big victory figuring out what was wrong with Robyn, but those moments are kind of like eating a piece of chocolate. I enjoy the satisfaction for about ten seconds, and then it's gone. See, the thing that sticks with me, is the look of anguish on a patients face when I give them crappy news. I hold on to that forever. You're a surgeon: you occasionally get to fix people, but I figure out whats wrong with someone and then most the time I can't do anything about it; I just wish them luck dealing with it, or try to keep them alive for a while longer. So, you wanna know if I'll always be a doctor? I'd have to say, I don't know. I'm a doctor now, I will be tomorrow, but I can tell you that, if I'm ever lucky enough to get married, to have some kids, to maybe not need the money, I think I'd walk out of here and never look back.</dd></dl>

It hasn't worked for me, it hasn't worked for anybody in my family, but there are certain signposts you can follow, you know, to try and make the best of it. Try not to yell at each other, that's always a great idea. Don't share any money; always sound, sound advice. Never strike each other above the shoulders: from here down, from here down for hitting...Don't share cars. You're gonna find that it always has the other person's stink on it. You can't get that stuff off your shirt, you're gonna live with it for the rest of your life, you don't want it when you're driving to work, you know?</dd></dl>
