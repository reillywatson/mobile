We're on the same page. It's unfortunate that when you wake up, all you'll know is that your hair is gone...because it's gonna be good. I'd wager your best ever. And it's a me thing, I'm sorry to say. I...have no patience. I mean, if I'd met you in a bar or at a party, I would have had you back here and on your back in an hour. But that's an hour of my life I would have never had back, an hour of listening to you talk about unicorns and your high-school boyfriend and how you hate the taste of beer. I'm just taking what you would have happily given. I mean, that's hardly a crime.</dd></dl>

Why waste my time?</dd><dd> <b>  Veronica </b> : Like why bother with something that's not good, just because it's something?</dd><dd> <b>  Piz </b> : Especially when you know the difference. Which not many people do. I mean, do you?</dd><dd> <b>  Veronica </b> : I - I think I do.</dd><dd> <b>  Piz </b> : You see I think it's like 90% of life, just knowing the difference.</dd></dl>

Point blank. It wasn't information that you had a right to know. I knew you wouldn't be able to deal with the Madison thing.</dd><dd> <b>  Veronica </b> : Which 'thing' are you talking about? The 'she roofied me thing' or the thing 'when I stumbled to my car in the morning wondering where my virginity was and she had written <i>  slut </i> on my windshield'? Was that what you thought I couldn't deal with? I am so genuinely sick right now. If I could've eaten anything today I'd be throwing up all over your floor.</dd><dd> <b>  Logan </b> : We were broken up at the time.</dd><dd> <b>  Veronica </b> : You know how I feel about <i>  her </i> ! There is no way that at some point while <i>  it </i> was happening you weren't thinking about how much I'd <i>  hate </i> you being with her.</dd><dd> <b>  Logan </b> : It wasn't like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Veronica </b> : No?
