Season 1 (2005)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> But this show is not about me. This program is dedicated to you, the heroes. And who are the heroes? The people who watch this show. Average, hardworking Americans. You're not the elites, you're not the country club crowd. I know for a <i>  fact </i> that my country club would never let you in. But you <i>  get it </i> . And you come from a long line of it-getters.</dd></dl>

Season 2 (2006)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen </b> : <i>  (Talking about how Magna morphs and the magnetic parts that they feature. Colbert had attached the bear's head to the eagle's body) </i> This allows you to combine our proud symbol of American freedom, <i>  with a godless killing machine!! </i> Look at that! Half-bear, half-eagle, it's a beagle! And this is a grizzly, so it's a greagle. <i>  Kill it! Kill it! (Panically dismantles the "greagle") </i> .</dd></dl>
Season 2 (2006)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> I've got 99 problems, but the truth ain't one. This is The Colbert Report!</dd></dl>
Season 2 (2006)

The Great Escape ... Escape from New York ... The Big Apple ...Apples and Oranges... A Clockwork Orange ... Stanley Kubrick ...directed Barry Lyndon ... Lyndon Johnson , oh my God! It was all a plot by Lyndon Johnson to attain the presidency so he could escalate the involvement in the Vietnam War! <i>  [whispers] </i> Makes so much sense. Oh, if this code fell into the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> Let's try a current mystery. Varying reports on the Hurricane Katrina debacle are pointing fingers in many directions. Who's really to blame for the slow response to the disaster? Let's think about it: Hurricane Katrina... Katrina and the Waves ...Waves in the Oceans...Ocean's full of Fish... One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish ... Dr. Seuss ... The Cat in the Hat ... Mike Myers . Oh my God, it's Mike Myers' fault! No wonder he kept quiet when Kanye West started blaming President Bush! <br /> <br /> Okay, now let's use this for something important. Everyone wants to know who's gonna win the Oscars. Let's start with Best Supporting Actress : you get support from support groups like AA ... AAA ... XXX ... X the Owl...Henrietta Pussycat ... What's New Pussycat ... Tom Jones ... Star Jones ... Star Wars ... WarGames ... Winter Games ...Wintergreen...Winter Garden... beer garden ...Weisse Beer... Rachel Weisz will win Best Supporting Actress! Oh, she is so lovely.</dd></dl>

Season 2 (2006)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> You said, "Anyone who grew up on a farm knows that evolution exists." OK, are you saying a monkey can milk a cow?</dd><dd> <b>  Peter Agre  : </b> Well, if I can milk a cow I suspect a monkey as smart as I am can milk a cow.</dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> Are there monkeys as smart as you?</dd><dd> <b>  Agre: </b> I'm sure there are quite a few, quite a few.</dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> Oh really?

Season 2 (2006)
<dl><dd> <i>  Following the Democratic victory in the 2006 Midterm Elections. </i></dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> The people have spoken - and apparently they're tired of freedom. Don't get me wrong, I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. I thought this country would last longer than 230 years. That's it, folks, America is over. At this point, we might as well just give it back to the goddamn Indians. Let's see how they'd deal with foreign enemies bent on their destruction. Here's your cake, terrorists! There you go. Enjoy. <i>  [tasting the icing] </i> Mmm, tastes like surrender. Jimmy, you might as well get those subtitles going. <i>  [Arabic subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen] </i> There you go. Get used to these. And you know what? We should probably throw a burqa over Meg while we're at it. <i>  [Meg the intern is shown wearing a burqa] </i> You know what really gets me here, you know what really gets me? Democrats didn't even win this thing, the Republicans lost it. They ran away from the president. "Hey, the ship's in trouble, quick, let's drown the captain!" We were <i>  this </i> close to Jesus coming back. And you Republicans that turned your back on the president are going to wander in the desert for the next two years. Literally, someone's going to have to replace those troops in Iraq! And don't think you're off the hook, voters, you're the ones who made this bed. Now you're the ones who are going to have to move over so a gay couple can sleep in it. Tomorrow you're all going to wake up in a brave new world, a world where the Constitution gets trampled by an army of terrorist clones, created in a stem-cell research lab run by homosexual doctors who sterilize their instruments over burning American flags. Where tax-and-spend Democrats take all your hard-earned money and use it to buy electric cars for National Public Radio, and teach evolution to illegal immigrants. <i>  Oh, and everybody's high! </i> You know what, I've had it! You people don't deserve a Republican majority! Screw this! I quit!</dd></dl>
Season 2 (2006)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> <i>  [getting into his car] </i> Take me home, Sam.</dd><dd> <i>  The driver turns around. It's  Uncle Sam  . </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sam: </b> You are home, Stephen. The Colbert Nation is your home - and it needs you now, more than ever.</dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> No it doesn't.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam: </b> Yes it does! The Democrats have only been in power for a few minutes and already they've already got us stuck in this unwinnable war!</dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> <i>  [with realization dawning] </i> Yeah, they really screwed the pooch on that one. That Democratic majority has had a free ride for too long! Thanks, Sam! <i>  [moves to get out of the car] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sam: </b> You're welcome.</dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> <i>  [turning] </i> Oh, by the way, there was no sparkling water in my drink caddy.

Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> [Hillary Clinton] said one of her favorite movies is The Wizard of Oz. Well, I re-watched it recently, and I can't believe I never noticed the liberal subtext before. Judy Garland--gay icon--stars as Dorothy, an innocent girl from the Heartland, who gets swept away to a drug-induced fantasy land where's she's greeted by labor activists from the local guild. After she murders a powerful Oz official, she becomes a fugitive, hitting the road with a racially diverse group including a laborer, an animal-rights activist, and a treehugger. Who are all, for some mysterious reason, great dancers. And along the way, they get so high on poppies they think they're being attacked by flying monkeys. Folks, there's a short walk from "There's no place like home" to " It Takes a Village ."</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> I've always been a big fan of beauty. Sure, you can't judge a book by its cover but who wants to have sex with a book?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> <i>  [Upon learning that  Willie Nelson  has a Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream flavor.] </i> Willie Nelson has a flavor? What's in it, shredded tax forms and hash?</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> Join me next time on Colbert Platinum when I'll be joined by Master Chef Reginald Durham for a luxury cookout with the elite burger "Panda Patties". Mmmm. Yes, you can taste the rarity.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> Take it from me, there's nothing like a job well done, except the quiet enveloping darkness at the bottom of a bottle of Jim Beam after a job done any way at all.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> If you non-Catholic Christians are upset, well, just have your Pope issue a reponse. Oh, that's right, you don't have a Pope because your faith is defective. Sorry, Catholicism is clearly superior. Don't believe me? Name one Protestant denomination that could afford a $660 million sexual abuse settlement. I think that Lord has spoken on this one.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> [In response to Bill O'Reilly 's comparison of Daily Kos with the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazi party.] <i>  Exactly! The Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis were both notorious for allowing people to express unpopular views in an open and free forum. </i></dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)

<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> Love is a full-length mirror.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> Which brings me to threat number one: gravity. It is not enough--it is not enough that everyone in the mainstream media is against this President. Now even the laws of physics are jumping on the anti-Bush bandwagon? 'Course, I've known about gravity's liberal bias ever since my tenth grade science teacher, Mr. Stamp, dropped a bowling ball and a feather in a vacuum. Bowling ball should definitely have won. There's only one way that feather could keep up: affirmative action. Point is, we've lost gravity to the liberals, folks; but inertia, I hope you're listening! You of all principles of physics should know to stay the course.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> Every time the President comes up with a new secret tactic to take down al Qaeda, the media blows its cover. Torture, monitoring our phone calls, monitoring our emails, secret prisons, all perfectly reasonable temporary concessions of freedom that will only be in effect as long as our never-ending war on terror.</dd></dl>
Season 3 (2007)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> When I decided to run for president, I <i>  did not </i> do it for the attention. I did it to fulfill a <i>  dream </i> , of being the most popular man in the world.</dd></dl>
Season 4 (2008)
<dl><dd> <i>  Using The DaColbert Code to predict the next President </i></dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> The next President will live in the White House...white guy...Guy Smiley...smiley face...horse face...horseshoe...shoe box... Johann Sebastian Bach ... Baroque music ...Baroque Obama, NO!</dd></dl>
Season 4 (2008)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> <i>  [on his teleprompter being blank, thanks to the WGA strike] </i> Jim, what the hell is going on?

How does that affect me?</dd><dd> <b>  Jimmy: </b> We have nothing to put in the prompter.</dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> That's not my understanding of how this works, Jim. My understanding is that this little, this little, uh, magic box right here, it reads my thoughts and then it lays them up on the screen right there in little words that I read and--that my audience can hear my--it's a labor saving device, Jim, that's--that's how I understand this works.</dd><dd> <b>  Jimmy: </b> Well, no, actually it's what the writers put in.</dd><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> The writers. The guys on the fourth floor with the opium bongs playing Guitar Hero all day. You're telling me that those guys are responsible for what I say? I find that a bit of a stretch, Jim, I'm sorry. Get it fixed, and get it fixed now.</dd></dl>
Season 4 (2008)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> <i>  [on being shown Abraham Lincoln's hat] </i> Forget about the Secret Service, where was the fashion police?</dd></dl>

If it's a real Ferrari... someone will kick your ass.</dd></dl>
Season 4 (2008)
<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen: </b> It's no secret, folks. It's all over the news. We are living in some hard times. The economy is in the crapper, bin Laden is still at large, and Steve Gutenberg is on Dancing with the Stars. I wonder what star he's dancing with? Now I think, in fact, there wouldn't be any good news out there if it weren't for... Nazi gold.</dd></dl>
