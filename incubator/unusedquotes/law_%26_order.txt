Charge them with Man-one.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : We send a message that it's sort of okay to kill a baby? This isn't a couple of teenagers who killed their newborn because they were scared.

Jack, she went in a healthy woman, she came out a corpse!</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : Between the two of us, depraved indifference is a reach. Criminally negligent homicide is a gift!

Shield[9.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : Did Pelham ever complain to internal affairs about her?

Gunshow[10.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  Webber </b> : We weren't ignoring your requests. As a matter of fact, we had a meeting with our lawyers about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : What did ya'll decide?</dd><dd> <b>  Webber </b> : Much as we'd like to cooperate, it would force us to reveal trade secrets which would damage our ability to remain competitive.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : Trade secrets?

Season 10
Gunshow[10.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : Jack wants the jury to make a finding of emotion, not of fact. This isn't a trial. It's gun control by other means.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : They can sell guns on the internet. Talking about control is a joke.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : So this is your answer? Putting gun makers in jail?</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : I'd like to start by putting Rolff Firearms out of business!</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : Responsible adults can own firearms without the entire country sinking into criminal anarchy.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : What's the point? Maybe when the redcoats were coming over Bunker Hill.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : How about somebody six foot five coming through my door? The people have a right to defend themselves!</dd></dl>
Season 10
Gunshow[10.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  Judge Wright </b> : Mr. McCoy, I'm not going to sanction a verdict that cannot possibly be sustained on appeal. This conviction isn't based on any proven facts. It's based on the jury's outrage at Mr. Webber's irresponsible and inexcusable conduct. You want to end the violence, the bloodletting. So do I, Mr. McCoy. In my thirty years on the bench I've seen ever permutation of it and it sickens me when somebody profits from it! But tempted, though I may be, putting Mr. Webber in a jail won't end the carnage. Until we cure what ails the human heart it won't make a dent in the body count. In the meantime, no matter how profound our grief, our indignation, I can't let you use this court to raise a lynch mob. I won't allow you to exploit the same base actions that Mr. Webber counts on to beef up his bottom line. It's not about being right, Mr. McCoy. It's about doing right.</dd></dl>

There are more and more girls committing violent crimes. I don't see anything from Jenny except a future of escalating antisocial behavior.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : What makes you say that?</dd><dd> <b>  Skoda </b> : Emotional abuse. The snuffed cat. Blacked out photographs. Her lack of response when I went after her.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : Fantasies about hurting little boys.</dd><dd> <b>  Skoda </b> : Previews of coming attractions. She's graduated to murder, she's not going to stop.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : You sound pretty sure.</dd><dd> <b>  Skoda </b> : The kid's a done deal. She's a textbook serial killer. You just got her early.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : She denied knowing her mom had Parkinson's, she lied about the money, she's 0 for 2 and counting.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : Getting her paws on that money is a pretty good motive for a murder.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : Except it's her step-dad who pulled the trigger. Wow, what a cozy little family this is turning out to be.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : Once you turn to necrophilia, incest doesn't seem so bad.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : Moore must be feeling pretty stupid sitting in Riker's while Debbie is out spending up a storm. He might be in the mood to deal.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : I'm not. Get a search warrant for her office and home. We find evidence they had an affair, they can both rot.</dd></dl>

Season 11
Endurance[11.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : Your Honor, this is nothing more than Mr. Peck's conceit that he can pull a rabbit out of a hat, and his never ending love for an opportunity just to hear himself talk.</dd></dl>
Season 11
Endurance[11.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : It's possible she suppressed her memory of that night. It's possible she felt too guilty to fully participate in her own defense.</dd><dd> <b>  Carmichael </b> : It's also possible that her lawyer isn't the idiot that we take him for. He held on to this until he thought it would do the most good.</dd><dd> <b>  McCoy </b> : No, he's an idiot.</dd></dl>
