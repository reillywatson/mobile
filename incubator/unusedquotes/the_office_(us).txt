<dl><dd> <b>  Stanley </b> : It's like I used to tell my wife. I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong. And if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife and I'll say it to my next one, too.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Job Fair[4.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jim </b> : Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan: he was the temp here.

Season 4
Job Fair[4.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Pam </b> : Do you remember you specifically told me to bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. I said, "Are you sure, Michael?" And you said, "Pam! Pam! Pam!" And then you sneezed in my tea and then you said, "Don't worry, it's just allergies." Do you remember that?</dd></dl>

I dunno, I think you say things just to agree with me.</dd><dd> <b>  Dwight </b> : Would that be such a bad thing?</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Yeah, it would! Just have a thought! Have an original thought! Although I will agree that her head is weird.</dd></dl>

Season 4
Goodbye, Toby[4.18 &amp; 4.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Oscar </b> : Well, this is what happened. Uh, Ryan's big project was the website. Which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice. Once as offices and once in the website sales, which is what we refer to in the business as misleading the shareholders. Another good term is fraud. The real crime, I think, was the beard.</dd></dl>

Business Ethics[5.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me. And I think it's because they see me as one of them. But... cooler and with my life put together a little bit more. If a baby were President, there would be no taxes. There would be no war. There would be no... government, and... things could get terrible. And actually probably it would be a better screenplay idea then a serious suggestion.</dd></dl>

Scott's Tots[6.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Pam </b> : Obviously, there's been some kind of mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.</dd><dd> <b>  Andy </b> : That would be...employee #3, which is...son-of-a-bitch! Pam Halpert.</dd><dd> <b>  Phyllis </b> : How is that possible? No offense, Pam, but how the hell is that possible?</dd><dd> <b>  Dwight </b> : <i>  [feigning ignorance] </i> There must be <i>  some </i> reasonable explanation for this.</dd><dd> <b>  Pam </b> : Oh, wait, come on!

Season 6
Scott's Tots[6.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> I just, I fell in love with these kids. And I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system.

<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And I'm...pretty nervous about it. And I'm...making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star...or any number of drag queens.</dd></dl>

Sabre[6.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Andy </b> : Hey, any fun weekend plans?</dd><dd> <b>  Erin </b> : No, you?</dd><dd> <b>  Andy </b> : Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?</dd><dd> <b>  Erin </b> : Nothing. It's wide open.</dd><dd> <b>  Andy </b> : Okay.</dd><dd> <i>  [cuts to Andy in an interview] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Andy </b> : That's as hard as I can hint.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Manager and Salesman[6.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jo </b> : This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know? You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim?</dd><dd> <b>  Jim </b> : I don't think so.</dd><dd> <b>  Jo </b> : Michael?</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Forget the question.</dd><dd> <b>  Jo </b> : I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : I humbly accept the management position.</dd><dd> <b>  Jim </b> : Why would you just say something like that?</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Because, well, Jim, where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Manager and Salesman[6.16]

And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.</dd><dd> <b>  Pam </b> : I cannot wait for that joke to be over.</dd></dl>

Season 6
The Delivery[6.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together and I made a family.</dd></dl>

Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?</dd><dd> <b>  Kevin </b> : You said she liked me.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that could never be possible, Kevin.

New Leads[6.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Gabe </b> : Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just...imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice cream cone.</dd></dl>
