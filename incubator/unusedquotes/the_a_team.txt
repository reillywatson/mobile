Season 5
The Point of No Return[5.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Frankie: </b> I've always thought of Johnny as some kind of ... Superman ya' know?</dd><dd> <b>  B.A: </b> There ain't no body!</dd><dd> <b>  Frankie: </b> They don't always find a body B.A</dd><dd> <b>  Murdock: </b> Hey Frankie, do you know something we don't know? Why are you trying to convince us that Hannibal's dead?</dd><dd> <b>  Frankie: </b> I'm not! I'm just trying to face facts. Everything we've heard so far says that Johnny's not alive.</dd><dd> <b>  Face: </b> Frankie, there's not a shred of hard evidence that says that he's dead.</dd><dd> <b>  Frankie: </b> Yeah, except that goon back there who says he was killed!</dd><dd> <b>  Murdock: </b> WELL YOU SHOULDN'T BE LISTENING TO GOONS!!!</dd><dd> <i>  Silent Pause </i></dd><dd> <b>  Murdock: </b> I'm, I'm sorry, i'm sorry. It's just that g- goons are not a very reliable source of information you know.</dd><dd> <b>  Face: </b> Yeah, see the bottom line here Frankie is that were not gonna believe Hannibal's dead until we get some proof.</dd><dd> <b>  Murdock: </b> If there's no body, then Hannibal is alive.</dd><dd> <b>  Face: </b> I think the key to this whole mess is Bobby, that little peddycab peddler.</dd><dd> <b>  Frankie: </b> Yeah how come you haven't let Stockwell in on that one!?</dd><dd> <b>  Murdock: </b> Stockwell? Stockwell? Stockwell doesn't give a rats tail whether Hannibal is alive or dead!</dd><dd> <b>  B.A: </b> You got that right crazy man.</dd><dd> ' <i>  Stockwell walks into the room </i></dd><dd> <b>  Stockwell: </b> O.K we're upgrading the status of this mission to Code Red. Now according to Colonel Smith's message, we've got 16 hours before the plutonium shipment changes hands. I have arranged for our friend back there to be picked up in a half an hour. So I want you to stay here until then.</dd><dd> <b>  Face: </b> B.A and Frankie will uh, cover this end here for you, Murdock and I have something we've gotta check out.</dd><dd> <b>  Stockwell: </b> No, you're not checking anything out until the prisoner is picked up. Then I want you to meet Alice and me at Hop Louies. Understood?</dd><dd> <i>  Pause </i></dd><dd> <b>  Stockwell: </b> Is there a problem?</dd><dd> <b>  Murdock: </b> Yes. We do not believe that Hannibal is dead, General.</dd><dd> <b>  Stockwell: </b> That's an interesting fantasy, but we don't deal in fantasies in this business.</dd><dd> <b>  Frankie: </b> Fantasy? Whoa, whoa, whoa wait just a minute here. This situation is NO FANTASY!</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Point of No Return[5.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Stockwell: </b> Well, perhaps that was the wrong choice of words. No commander rests easily when one of his men has fallen. But men do die. Colonel Smith understood that. He took that responsibility. Now, we've got fifteen hours and fifty-eight minutes to find the plutonium, or it won't matter whether Hannibal Smith is alive or dead. The only thing that will matter, is whether he died in vain.</dd><dd> <i>  Another pause </i></dd><dd> <b>  Stockwell: </b> Now, you went against my instructions and got involved in this peddycab mess. They tried to kill you. <i>  Face and Murdock get up to leave while Stockwell has his back turned </i> . Obviously our cover was blown the minute you stepped in the hotel.</dd><dd> <i>  Stockwell loooks around to see Face and Murdock gone. Then he looks up at Frankie </i></dd><dd> <b>  Frankie: </b> Uh, Face saw a girl.</dd><dd> <b>  B.A: </b> And Murdock saw something in his head.</dd></dl>
