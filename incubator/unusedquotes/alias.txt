That was the assignment.</dd><dd> <b>  Danny </b> : It was obscene, right? About the teacher.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : He was a sexist pig. I deserved a scholarship for that.

I was hoping to get your approval.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Danny, let me ask you a question.</dd><dd> <b>  Danny </b> : Sure.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : How well do you know my daughter?</dd><dd> <b>  Danny </b> : Um, we've been dating for two years...</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Because if you feel the need to ask me about this scenario, I have a sense you don't know Sydney at all.</dd><dd> <b>  Danny </b> : Sir, I love your daughter and I want to marry her. That's why I'm calling.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : First of all, Danny, the truth is this is just a courtesy call. Like when you say to your neighbor, "We're having a loud party on Saturday night if that's all right with you." What you really mean is, "We're having a loud party on Saturday night."</dd><dd> <b>  Danny </b> : Mr. Bristow,...</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Sydney doesn't give a damn what my opinion is. What interests me is that you do.</dd><dd> <b>  Danny </b> : It's just a custom to call the father, that's all this is...</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Well, then, I'll tell you what. I may become your father-in-law, that's just fine. But I will not be used as part of a charming little anecdote you tell your friends at cocktail parties so they can see what a quaint, old-fashioned guy Danny really is. Are we clear?</dd><dd> <b>  Danny </b> : Yes, sir...</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Good. Then welcome to the family.</dd></dl>

Truth Be Told
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [After Danny has been murdered] </i> What did you do?</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I might ask you the same question. Security section became aware of the breach and performed their function. You're familiar with the codes of conduct, Agent Bristow. You knew these codes apply to you, even if you put to risk the lives of every man and woman working in the agency.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Danny wasn't a risk... he was... he was just a man. He was... he was a doctor, he was just...</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You listen to me. Information about this agency must be treated like a virus. There is only one response to a virus, and that response is containment. You put us in a compromised situation, and even though I despise the countermeasure, we have...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Stop saying "we." Stop talking about the agency. You killed the man I love!</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : No, Agent Bristow. You did.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : They're reviewing your statement. You wrote a lot.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I mean, it's like Tolstoy lot. Devlin says it could take weeks to verify. But I know we could use another double agent in SD-6, so we'll be in contact. I'm going to get you a ride out of here, keep you concealed. Why are you shaking your head?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Because you said another.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : So?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : So if you really had one already you most likely wouldn't tell me until I was authenticated.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Unless I had an instinct about you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : My bet is you don't...have another double.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : We might.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : But you want me to believe that you do, so that on the off chance that I'm actually looking to be a triple agent I'll report back that there's an existing mole to upset the balance of my agency.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I'm not trying to play you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yeah, we'll see.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You said you wanted to talk about the plan. I'm giving you the plan.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : It's not your job to give me the plan. I'm giving you the plan. Tomorrow's your first day back at SD-6. Now, nothing should change. When you get your assignment, you'll detail your mission on a paper bag. <i>  [picks one up, showing her] </i> Bag. Then you'll call this number. Memorize it. After three tones, press the appropriate digit -- one through six. Each corresponds to a trash can in a specific location. Now we'll review your information, create a countermission, and we'll contact you posing as a wrong number: Joey's Pizza. Any questions so far?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yeah.

<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Are you insane? Calling me in here for a social event? SD-6 has a division whose sole responsibility it is to track their agents and report back suspect activity. "Your girl" is risking her life, and you yours, every time we lay eyes on each other. So, do me a favor: don't be so friendly.</dd><dd> <b>  Lambert </b> : I-I just love your spirit.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : That's heartening. Are we done here?</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Lambert </b> : I hate to pull rank, but time is a factor here.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Time <i>  is </i> a factor here. You know how much time? Seven years. That's how long I worked for SD-6 before I found out who they really are. And now that I know, my days of blindly following orders are over.</dd><dd> <b>  Lambert </b> : Who the hell do you think you're talking to?</dd><dd> <b>  Sidney </b> : I know exactly who I'm talking to. Tell Devlin if Agent Vaughn isn't on the other end of this earpiece when I turn it on, the C.I.A. gets nothing.</dd><dd> <b>  Lambert </b> : Vaughn is a junior officer.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Then promote him.</dd></dl>

A Broken Heart
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I'm sorry to call you. I just didn't know who else to call. My father and I were supposed to have dinner tonight for the first time since I was a kid. I can't even remember the last time. He just didn't show. He said he had work. And he didn't have work. This isn't just about my dad. When I was in Morocco the man who died was a friend of mine. He was a good man! Who thought he was fighting for the right side, that he was working for the CIA. He was lied to and now he's dead. I had his blood on my hands!</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Sydney --</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I feel like I'm losing my mind, like I don't even know who I am anymore, or what I'm doing, or why I'm doing it.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You just threw your beeper in the Pacific.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : When you first walked into my office with that stupid Bozo hair, I thought you were crazy. I thought you might actually be a crazy person. But I watched you, and I read your statement, and I've seen... I've seen how you think, I've seen how you work, I've seen how you are in this job. In this job, you see darkness. You see the worst in people and though the jobs are different and the missions change, and the enemies have a thousand names, the one crucial thing, the one real responsibility you have is to not let your rage, and your resentment, and your disgust, darken you. When you're at your absolute lowest, at your most depressed, just remember that you can always -- you know. You got my number.</dd></dl>

Acting cavalier about breaking the rules. Think about the last time you did something like that. I'm not a perfect man. I know that.

Color-Blind
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : The irony is they never lied to me about what would happen if I told someone. It was the one thing they said that turned out to be true. Now I'm a double agent for the C.I.A. and I will be until SD-6 is gone.</dd></dl>

Mea Culpa
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : We both are. We're both doing our job. And I look at Sydney Bristow's test results -- I don't see a single spike. She didn't falter once.</dd><dd> <b>  Dreyer </b> : She's guilty. She's the one.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I think that's a dangerous accusation made by a desperate man.</dd><dd> <b>  Dreyer </b> : I'm not desperate, Mr. Sloane. But I am curious why you feel the need to defend Miss Bristow?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Mea Culpa
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : <i>  [holding a gadget] </i> Okay, now, this thing sucks...literally. Sucks all the information from the computer hard drive right into the internal flash RAM.</dd></dl>

Mea Culpa
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I always knew there was something about you, from the first time I saw you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : A lot can change in seven years.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : It's been a lot longer than seven years. I've known your father since 1971. I met him at Langley. I knew your mother. I went to your parents' wedding. Sydney, I've known you since you were a baby. I was out of the country for most of your childhood, various operations, but I kept tabs on you. I checked in on you in my own way. I always thought of you as my daughter, even from the beginning. Well, I just wanted to let you know...before you went away.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Mea Culpa
<dl><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Okay, okay, whatever, it sucks, all right? But it's why I wanted to become a reporter. I saw this when I was a kid and I loved it. And I was just like, I don't know, all the quick...</dd><dd> <b>  Francie </b> : Repartee.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it just looked fun.

Season 1
Spirit
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I need you to tell me what's happening!</dd><dd> <b>  Steven </b> : You didn't hear this from me. <i>  [Pause] </i> While Sydney and Russek were in Geneva, a transmission was recorded from her location and it was not one of ours.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You think it was Sydney?</dd><dd> <b>  Steven </b> : This is not the first indication that she might be working for someone else.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Spirit
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : <i>  [Speaking to Sydney] </i> For the past few weeks, you've been under suspicion. We knew we had a mole and there were signs that indicated that it was you. And then when you were in Geneva, we picked up a third-party transmission and it seemed to confirm that you betrayed SD-6. And what I just learned is that it wasn't your transmission. It was Russek's.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Spirit
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : In the cell, when Russek was trying to get me to talk, I asked him questions about his interrogation. When he told me that they threatened to kill him, he was blinking at erratic intervals -- a classic indication that he was lying. So, I didn't talk only because I knew he wasn't in any real danger. Either Sloane still thinks I'm the mole and is using me somehow --</dd></dl>
Season 1
Spirit
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Look, to you, my job might seem pointless and stupid but it's not. It's far from pointless and if you knew what I dealt with every day, you might even thank me for doing my job so well!</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : <i>  [Confused] </i> What the hell are you talking about?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Nothing. I'm going to work. I'll see you guys.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Spirit
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I didn't know how it would finally materialize: the darkness. I had nothing to base it on. It wasn't as if the C.I.A. had just betrayed me, that my wife had just been diagnosed with lymphoma. None of that had happened yet. So, whenever life takes an unfortunate turn, as it has this week, I just remind myself that I could see it coming all along.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Confession
<dl><dd> <i>  [After Sydney and Jack have escaped from captivity] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : It took me a second to realize what you were doing.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I was blinking as fast as I could.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know. I was like, "Hard on your light"?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Guard on your right.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Well, I figured it out. I was just never very good at Morse code.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Confession
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Dad, can I ask you something? When you started with SD-6, you knew that they were a mercenary group and they had no connection with the C.I.A. But I didn't. When I joined, I thought I was going to be saving the world and not making it more dangerous.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : What's the question?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Why didn't you say something? I mean, you could have told me what I was really doing -- damage instead of good -- but you kept quiet.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [Sighs] </i> Revealing the truth about what you were doing would have required revealing the truth about what I was doing.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Confession
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What happens when someone you care about is in trouble? What you said, that nothing else matters. It all just goes away. Last week when I learned what my father did for me, sacrificing Russek, it made me sick. But now, I know I would have done exactly the same thing. You should have seen him.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Your father?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yeah, he was like ... he was like a pro. He was good. I mean, the way you talked about him once, what his reputation was, I could see it in action. He was ... impressive.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Confession
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : There's nothing routine about that list. There's something very specific about it. It's been a mystery within the agency for over two decades. Who murdered those C.I.A. officers? I'm sorry, but we have our answer now. It was your father. And I'm going to report him.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Confession
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Those Cyrillic codes you found in those books -- yes, they were orders from the KGB and yes, they were orders to kill. An agent received those orders and carried them out, murdered officers of the C.I.A., including your father, Mr. Vaughn. All this is true. But, Sydney, I was not that agent. Your mother was.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Box, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I know how this feels.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Not exactly. You've had a lot longer to make sense of this than I have.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : There was a time when this was news to me, too. Your mother was sent to the United States to steal secrets from a ranking officer of the C.I.A. How she and I happened to meet, how she supposedly fell in love, I thought it was all true. But it was just a set-up.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Box, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [Talking to Vaughn about her mother] </i> There's this woman, her personality like a collage I've put together from the photographs, the few memories I have, scraps of stories I've heard, the clothes of hers I've got, her books, and none of it's real. She wasn't that woman at all. She was -- she was a horrible person, who killed your father. Vaughn, I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Box, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  McKenas Cole </b> : But another part that sucks is seeing guys you worked with, guys you thought were tougher than deer jerky... tortured to death. That's no good.</dd></dl>

The Box, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Dad, wait. You are not doing this.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Of course I am.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : No, you're not. You're going to have to crawl through a maze of airshafts, get to Marshall's office, get the scrambler, get to the vault room and scramble the code all in under ten minutes.

The Box, Part II
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Did you study bomb diffusion at Langley?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Just seminar style. Nothing field specific.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Does anyone ever learn anything at seminars?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Okay, let's just take this one step at a time. This is a charge of C-4.

Season 1
The Box, Part II
<dl><dd> <b>  McKenas Cole </b> : <i>  [to Sydney] </i> I know you didn't wanna kiss me, but when I was taking a hit off that bottle before, I backwashed in it. I mean, like, really big-time.</dd></dl>

I'm out of practice when it comes to, uh... personal matters.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Dad, I'm in no rush.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Believing your mother was a professor may have influenced you somewhat, but the decision to go back to school was yours and I'd trust that.

I, uh, I think I wasn't clear about something. <i>  [Pause] </i> That it would be nice to be in public with you, to actually get to look at you. Grab a pizza or go to a hockey game. I-I just...

About eight years ago he created an encryption system that we wanted to acquire, but he wouldn't sell. We don't have audio, but we got hold of the prison log. This is Tippin's third visit to McNeil in the last two weeks. You and I talked about Tippin some time ago.

<dl><dd> <i>  [As the FBI is taking Sydney into custody] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Those medical tests you took, they were looking to match three specific anomalies Rambaldi mentioned: DNA sequencing, platelet levels, and the size of your heart. You match all three.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : So what does the prophecy say?</dd><dd> <b>  Evans </b> : "This woman here depicted will possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works.

Q &amp; A
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : The truth is, I didn't love any of the subjects I was studying. My father and I weren't speaking, my mother had died when I was six and the highlight of my social life was my dorm's salad bar. So, I called them.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : SD-6.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : They didn't use that name. These men led me to believe they were CIA. They were very convincing. <i>  Are </i> very convincing.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Q &amp; A
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I might not have been a genius at nineteen years old, but I was smart enough to know what questions to ask. They had all the right answers.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Says here you were a genius.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Q &amp; A
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You're saying that Sydney could be held long enough to blow her cover with SD-6?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Under directive 81A, they could conceivably hold her without trial or charges for the rest of her life.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Q &amp; A
<dl><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : What does "SD" stand for?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Section Disparu: the section that doesn't exist. Alain Christophe, one of the Alliance founders, the term was his.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Explain to us about the Alliance of Twelve.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : The Alliance is like a board of directors. Some are from the private sector, but most are former intelligence officers. All wealthy. They started a company together, except this company -- the Alliance -- trades intelligence.</dd></dl>

Sydney, how much do you remember about the year after you were told that your mother died?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I remember... just feeling disconnected from everything. My father was away on business for most of that year.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : No. Your father spent six months in solitary in a federal prison. He was suspected of being in collusion with Laura. The FBI almost tried him for treason and even though he was vindicated, the damage was done. And he began to unravel.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Unravel...</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : He drank. He started taking unnecessary risks. Come on, Sydney, you know the father he was to you all those years. He took a long time to fully recover, and I was under direct orders from the DCI not to let him know that Laura had survived the accident. Unfortunately, that also required lying to you.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You know I can't do that.</dd><dd> <b>  Noah </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Well, for about a million reasons.</dd><dd> <b>  Noah </b> : I highly doubt there are a million reasons. There might be fifty, and I'd like the opportunity to refute all of them.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : One of the biggest reasons that comes to mind is my mother. Khasinau was her superior.

Season 1
The Solution

Season 1
The Solution
<dl><dd> <b>  Francie </b> : See, the thing about rats is they're clever. You have to out think them. You can't really just leave out cheese. You have to leave the good stuff. The heavy-duty stuff.

A meeting to take place at your contact's discretion.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Why would he lead me to you knowing that you'd want to flush him out?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : He only told you my name so you would realize that my threat to you was a bluff.

Season 1
Rendezvous
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I feel rather awkward sitting here asking you to allow my wife to die of cancer.</dd><dd> <b>  Christophe </b> : Arvin, the agreement is simple. People with any unauthorized information regarding SD-6, or any SD cell, must be eliminated.</dd></dl>

I know you genuinely care for her. I do, too. But there is a line that we have been sworn not to cross. We're about a mile past that.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I don't know how to be Sydney's handler without making it personal.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Figure out a way.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : He is my friend. He is, like, one of my best friends.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I understand that.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : No, you don't. You get to tell your friends that you work for the CIA while I go home and look desperately for a tiny moment that I can be honest with anyone about anything. Now that Will knows the truth - he's never going to trust me again. You should have seen his face in Paris. It was like he was looking at a stranger.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : But he wasn't.

Just think about everything we've been through. Just think about who I am. Now, what I am going to ask you to do is just accept the fact that I cannot tell you what this is about. What I am doing is classified but Dixon... I swear to you that I am not betraying this country. I could never do that. You know that!</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : I don't need rhetoric, Sydney.

Almost Thirty Years
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Hi. How did you find me?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You told me a couple of months ago that when you feel the need to disappear, you go to the observatory. But the observatory was closed. And then I remembered you said the pier calms you down. But you weren't there. And you weren't at the bluffs and the palisades, either.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You didn't really go to all those places.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Yeah, I did.

Season 2
The Enemy Walks In
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I met Emily shortly after I started working at Credit Dauphine. Like many young women, I was intimidated... by the world. I was sort of desperate for a little guidance. As he had been for most of my life, my father was busy working. I'd lost my mother when I was six... so I didn't have anyone to go to. No role model. Arvin invited me for dinner one night. I remember after dinner was over, Emily walked me out to the car. I didn't know her at all and she said in this simple, reassuring voice... "You're gonna be okay." Thinking of Emily, I often wondered about my own mother and what she would have been like, had she lived. Would she have been as strong as Emily? As kind, as good? I always told myself that she would have had those qualities even though I couldn't see them, I simply believed them. But Emily wasn't just the mother I never had. She was the mother all of us wish we had.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Enemy Walks In
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : The only way SD-6 will let you live is if you destroy the life you've got.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : I understand that, but you can't think of another way than this?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Yes, I can think of a number of other ways. But they all involve your burial.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Is that your idea of a joke? You're morbid, Jack.</dd></dl>

The Enemy Walks In
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Barnett </b> : And you did all this with a bullet in your shoulder?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Do you not believe me?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Barnett </b> : It's impressive.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Not really. One thing I have learned doing this - there's no drug like adrenaline.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Enemy Walks In
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Barnett </b> : One more thing. You haven't said anything about your mother.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What, am I supposed to say something insightful? The first time I see my mother in twenty years, and she almost kills me. Which would have made me the thirteenth CIA officer she's killed. She's former KGB. She's betrayed my father. She's betrayed me. She's betrayed this country. All anyone needs to know about that woman is that she's a bad guy.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Barnett </b> : I think this was a good beginning.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Trust Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : The idea that the CIA is willing to work with Irina Derevko is insane.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Worse, it's naive. Your mother didn't just conveniently turn herself in. This is all part of the manipulation.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Well, she's their problem now. She's not yours. And she's not mine.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Trust Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Just so we're clear, Mr. Vaughn, I know all about your participation in busting Agent Bristow out of federal custody. Convince her to talk to her mother, or face charges of obstructing justice and harboring a fugitive.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Guess it's two-for-one day on blackmail.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Trust Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : She told me to pull the alarm.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Yes, and for all you know, that could've made things worse. Sydney, you're smarter than this. Your mother wants you to think she's your ally. That she can help you get what you want. Her intel might even be accurate once, twice, but the minute you start depending on her, she will gut you.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Trust Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [Referring to Irina] </i> Sydney, she is the enemy.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : And so is Sloane. And if the devil herself wants to help me bring him down, fine by me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Trust Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Let's get something clear. You are not my mother. My mother was Laura Bristow. Laura Bristow died in a car accident twenty-one years ago. You are a traitor and a prisoner of the United States government. <i>  [Irina looks away] </i> Look at me! We will interact only when necessary. You will address me as "Agent Bristow" and answer only the questions I ask. There will be no personal anecdotes, no comments about my job performance, no condolences or congratulations.

Season 2
Cipher
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : I've had this picture of your face in my mind for twenty years. I remember a loving husband, generous man, patriot. I may have been under orders to fabricate a life with you, but there were times when the illusion of our marriage was as powerful for me as it was for you, especially when Sydney was born. Looking at you now, I see that illusion is finally gone.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I want to make something very clear to you. There are people here who believe you can repay the debt you owe this country through your continued cooperation. I am not one of them. And if Sydney in any way becomes victim to your endgame, I will kill you. She spent most of her life believing you were dead, she'll get used to it again. No matter what bond you try to forge with her.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : You haven't told her what you did to her after I disappeared... have you?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : You know, you haven't asked me how I could shoot my own daughter.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : No, I haven't.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : I assume you wouldn't need this combination so urgently if you didn't know where the music box was. Sark won't hesitate to kill you. I don't want to lose the chance to explain myself someday.</dd></dl>

Cipher
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : Speaking of Ms. Adams... just before I left I remember her encouraging you to try out for your school's Thanksgiving play. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but in the twenty years since I last saw you I often wondered... what part did you play?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I don't remember. It was around the time I was told my mother had died. Everything else is a blur.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Cipher
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Dad... do you remember the Thanksgiving play I was in that year in school? Because I sort of do. I mean, I have an impression of it, but I can't remember, was I a pilgrim, or an Indian?</dd><dd> <i>  [Jack stares off] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You were neither. You were a turkey. You were the only turkey that was spared to celebrate the harvest.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Cipher
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You want me to talk to her again.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Mr. Sark has assumed control of your mother's operation...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Please stop referring to her as my mother.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Therefore, Ms. Derevko must know what he's looking for and she's made it clear she will only speak with you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Look, I talked to her before because I had to. I have no intention of making this into a habit.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : I assume you have an opinion on this, Agent Vaughn.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Uh, I don't have an easy answer to that.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : I'll take a complicated one.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I can't pretend to hide my bias here. Irina Derevko betrayed this country and killed my father in the process. On the other hand, she is a certifiable Rambaldi expert and probably knows more about the inner workings of global organized crime than any other person in U.S. custody. Having said that, I believe Agent Bristow and I were effectively countering SD-6 before Derevko turned herself in and I stand behind whatever she decides.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : How do you say "thank you" to the woman who killed your father?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : <i>  [pause] </i> You don't.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Dead Drop
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Whatever Arvin Sloane pays you, it can't be enough. Would you consider coming to work for me if it meant I'd let you walk out of here? I believe if you took the time to hear the comprehensive offer, you might actually say yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [looks him up and down] </i> You're cute, but I'll pass.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Dead Drop
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You asked me what I was afraid of. I can tell you, it's obvious. I'm afraid of losing my daughter.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Dead Drop
<dl><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Well, I've got four weeks left of community service and then I'm done. Hey, um, you remember last week when I cooperated and let the CIA hypnotize me?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : What happened with that? I mean, was I helpful at all? And I'm only asking because about five minutes ago I was doing pretty well as a reporter, you know, and now I'm a dishwasher living in denial. That's all.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : The information you provided was huge.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Dead Drop
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Irina Derevko gave you the operations manual for her syndicate. I would like you to tell me where you've hidden it.</dd><dd> <b>  Richter </b> : Derevko is a great woman.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Morphine's not bad, either. Let me be clear. I've only given you enough to last five minutes. Cooperate and get all you want. Resist and you get none.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Indicator
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Okay. I'll confer with your father about your countermission.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : My father?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : He didn't tell you? Based on your father's instincts in the Madagascar incident, Devlin gave him operational approval.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Indicator
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Sydney, Washington has made a decision regarding your mother. What she did to you invalidated her agreement with the CIA. The government is pressing charges. They're going to seek the death penalty.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Indicator
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I saw de Souza. He told me that you hired him to rig those explosives.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Irina Derevko would eagerly destroy all of our lives.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I'm not a big fan, either. It still doesn't justify what you did.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You do good work, Agent Vaughn. But your consistent shortcoming - you should know this - is your naive sense of morality. Evil must be eliminated by whatever means necessary.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Indicator
<dl><dd> <b>  Kerr </b> : Agent Bristow, I've seen your profile. Your spatial intelligence is stellar. It's no surprise that you can solve the puzzle.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : But I wasn't solving it. When I was standing there, staring at the puzzle, it was like I remembered where every piece belonged. There wasn't any thought involved. You said the KGB developed a similar project, it's possible that my mother knew the techniques and maybe she -</dd><dd> <b>  Kerr </b> : Agent Bristow. If you are looking to uncover a trauma then I need to warn you. Hypnotic regression can trigger severe nightmares, flashbacks, acute depression -</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Understand that to do what I do, maintain my cover at SD-6, I compartmentalize a lot. But the idea that I might have been programmed to be a spy ... I can't tuck that away. I need to know what happened to me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Indicator
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I've seen the footage. Mom's briefing with her KGB handler. She was sent here for one specific purpose, to steal information from you about a project you were developing for the CIA. An operation to train children to be American spies. Project Christmas. Ever since Mom came back, you were afraid she'd figure out what you did to me. You weren't trying to protect me from her, you were trying to protect your secret. So the first opportunity you had, you set her up. In Madagascar.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Sydney, understand something--</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : No, Dad, you understand something. You took away my choices in life. You programmed me to be a spy. I will never forgive you for this.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Salvation
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Please try to understand what I'm about to tell you, Sydney. After your mother left, I tested Project Christmas on you because I didn't want you to be a victim. I thought it was my responsibility to teach you how to think strategically, to see through people's lies, to be as strong as you could be in an environment where one mistake could cost you your life.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Then you should've told me the truth before I ended up here.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Yes, you're right! I never intended you to lead a double life. I imagined recruiting you into the CIA after you finished college. But Sloane got to you first, and that is a mistake I will never live down.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I'd like to believe you, but I don't trust anything you say.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Salvation
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I spent a decade with this woman and another twenty years analyzing how she could have deceived me for so long. Trust me when I tell you, I am protecting you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : No, you're not. I think you loved Mom so much that when she left you, you lost your soul. You know what else I think? I think the kind of man who'd use his own daughter to frame her mother, who'd test psych experiments when she was six-years-old is the kind of man who looks at his daughter and sees his greatest mistake.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You can't honestly believe that.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : It's true, isn't it? If Mom hadn't fooled you, if you hadn't been so gullible, I never would have been born.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Salvation
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Look, I know this will drive you insane, but we can't employ you because you have a criminal record.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : I have a criminal record because of a drug habit I never had.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Salvation
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [talking about Sydney at his hearing] </i> When I look at her, when I look at the little girl who raised herself to become one of the most extraordinary human beings and one of the finest agents I've ever had the privilege of knowing, I see only the promise of my own redemption. Turning myself in was the only way I could think of to make that clear to her, to prove that despite... my limited abilities as a father, I love her more than I could ever say.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Counteragent
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I'm trying to live a normal life, which was always hard given what I do. But it's gotten harder since I met your daughter. It's not that knowing her hasn't made my life better. It has. But it's also made it that much worse. I think I've said enough.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : The problem, Mr. Vaughn, is that to the one person who matters, you haven't said anything.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Listen, this may not mean anything to you. This may not be something you can understand or appreciate, but we have rules. Very clear and important rules that govern the relationship between a handler and his asset.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : And between a man and a woman?</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Counteragent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Approaching the building.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Good luck, Sydney.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I don't need you to wish me luck, you son of a bitch.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : That's a wonderful attitude.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Counteragent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : I need access to Arvin Sloane.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Because I intend to kill him.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I can get you to Sloane, but only if you promise to let me keep the antidote.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : No. Sloane first. Then you'll get back your precious antidote.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Counteragent
<dl><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : What exactly did you promise Sark?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : That I would render Sloane unconscious and deliver him to Sark.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : So he could kill him.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : There are just so many problems with this that I don't even know where to begin.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Counteragent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Tell me you agree with me, that we have no choice in this.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Of course we have a choice. And it's a moment I never wanted you to face. To kill someone. I'm not talking about self-defense. I'm talking about premeditated murder. To be there when the door closes on him for the last time. Knowing you are responsible. That is something you never came close to considering before getting to know your mother.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : <i>  [to Sydney] </i> You're so willing to take risks for your country. Why aren't you willing to do the same for your own happiness?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : <i>  [to Sydney] </i> This watch belonged to my father. It's broken now, but it used to keep perfect time. And when he gave it to me, he said, "You could set your heart by this watch." It stopped October 1st -- the day we met.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : <i>  [to Sark] </i> Hi. Welcome. Don't kill me.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Look, I understand that none of you are inclined to believe a word I say but I assure you, it's not in my best interest to betray you. You've given me an opportunity of a lifetime, and I don't intend to squander it.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : I must admit, this is one of the most impressive operations I've seen. Though it is a touch pathetic how so many of them believe they actually work for the CIA.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Look at me. You've offered me a substantial prize to make our partnership worthwhile, but do not think for a second that gives you the right to insult my people.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part I
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [to Jack] </i> You said you didn't tell us the truth because you were trying to protect me, because you didn't want to risk Sark finding out that I was a double agent. The thing is, someone now has the ability to detonate six nuclear weapons and I am responsible. So I am going to be part of the team that finds and disarms those warheds no matter what you do. But if you were telling the truth when you said you wanted to protect me, then, Mom, I need your help.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part II
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : What do you want?</dd><dd> <b>  Mysterious Caller </b> : One hundred million in bearer bonds.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : This is about money?</dd><dd> <b>  Mysterious Caller </b> : Everything is about money. Instructions for the drop have been electronically mailed to you. You have twenty-four hours. Fail to deliver the bonds, and the next delivery will go to the Alliance.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part II
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : So, Sydney, how's school?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I'm writing my dissertation... supposedly.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part II
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You know, some people go miniature golfing with their parents. We go to India and look for nukes.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part II
<dl><dd> <b>  Cuvee </b> : Not to brag, but I'm kind of responsible for matchmaking you and Irina. Didn't she tell you? I was a supervisor at the KGB. I was the one who gave her the assignment to go to the US and marry a CIA officer. Now, you weren't the only prospect, of course. But you had the most potential. Ha! I actually thought it would dawn on you that a woman like this would never go for someone like you. Luckily for me, your ego was too big for that.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passage, Part II
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : You must have a lot of questions.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : One thing that should not wait any longer is why I shot you in Taipei. The rebel leader, Gerard Cuvee... When you were in Taipei, he was in the next room watching to see if I would betray him or you. Shooting you in the shoulder, giving you time to escape, it was the only way I could think to maintain his trust and keep him from killing both of us.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Abduction
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : You know what I always say - if it ain't Baroque, don't fix it!</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Abduction
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [to Will] </i> But after Danny and what happened to you, I've accepted the fact that it's a gesture of love to deceive the people I care about.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Abduction
<dl><dd> <b>  Ariana Kane </b> : More secrets have been revealed through pillow talk than through torture. If there's a prostitute or a stewardess out there you think may have heard you talking in your sleep, I need to know about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : There is one way for you to verify if my nocturnal activities are a security risk, Ms. Kane, but somehow I think we'd both prefer the torture.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Abduction
<dl><dd> <b>  Ariana Kane </b> : Men always call women crazy when they're caught with their pants down.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Abduction
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : I don't imagine that means you've decided to trust me?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Our previous... dealings would indicate that your strategy here may be long-term. So for now, I trust that your behavior is predictable.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : By "previous dealings" you mean our marriage? You know, technically, we may still be husband and wife.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Higher Echelon
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I have a crush on a guy from work.</dd><dd> <b>  Francie </b> : Really? Who is he?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Someone in my department. We've worked together for about a year now.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Higher Echelon
<dl><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : I just got off the phone with the director again and he asked me again if I knew we were in the intelligence business.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Higher Echelon
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [About Sloane's reaction upon losing Marshall] </i> It was as if someone had overcooked his steak.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Higher Echelon
<dl><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : I speak nine languages. Techno is not one of them!</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Higher Echelon
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I got your psych report back. You did well.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : I'm not a sociopath?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Well, I didn't say that. <i>  [laughs] </i></dd></dl>
Season 2
The Getaway
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : How long have you known about this?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I didn't tell you because it didn't concern you!</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : If the Alliance thinks you're lying to them, they'll kill you. That concerns me!</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : What concerns me is having them suspect that you're my accomplice. That's why I kept you out of it.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Getaway
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : So we can assume a secondary objective, which is to make Arvin suffer. Someone harboring an acute hatred - meaning it could be anyone.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Getaway
<dl><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : I share my fights with you!</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : No you don't.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Yeah, you remember when, er, remember when Alan pissed in the living room?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : That was your dog.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Yeah, but I was angry about it and I let you know how upset I was.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Getaway
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Actually, um, Mr. Sloane, I noticed you're not wearing the tie I gave you.</dd><dd> <i>  [Sloane ignores his comment] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : <i>  [faded smile] </i> It's okay.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Getaway
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Involving you had no upside.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : There's no upside to keeping me informed? You didn't tell me about Monolo or that you had discussions with my mother! You didn't even tell me that you were seeing Alice again!</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Wait. What is this about?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : This is about me being too old to be coddled!</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phase One
<dl><dd> <b>  Geiger </b> : Jack, I know you are disloyal. I know your daughter is too. Both your files, there were so many red flags, I thought I was in a Russian airport.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phase One
<dl><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : There's no way that guy smells as good as you.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : It's aftershave. I got a new aftershave.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Yeah, well, I'd lighten up on it.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Yeah?</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Oh, yeah. To the point of, er, non-use.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phase One
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : The new boss has a dreadful personality, don't you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I've seen worse.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Am I supposed to take that personally?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phase One
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : And the thing that makes me crazy every day is people that would kill us if we're seen together - the Alliance, SD-6, Sloane - are the very forces that brought you into my life to begin with. What kind of a sick joke is that?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phase One
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I need you to tell me.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You need me to tell you what? That when you're on operations, I can't sleep at night? That when we're in debrief I have to force myself to remember what the hell we're supposed to be reviewing when all I wanna do is kiss you?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Double Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : About last night ...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Is this going to be about Alice?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know it's complicated ...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : We're not together anymore.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Since when?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Since this morning. The truth is, we've been over for a long time.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Double Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Lennox </b> : I could've sworn you were a blonde.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I was. My hair's usually brown. Hard to keep track.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Double Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : We've decrypted the specs on Project Helix that you and Vaughn obtained. The data describes a breakthrough in next-generation molecular gene therapy. It refers to a new procedure whereby a patient's face and body are reshaped to identically resemble someone else. Agent Lennox was the first test subject to be doubled.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Double Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : How is this possible without obvious scarring?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : The procedure isn't surgical. A patient's genetic code is altered to reshape their physical attributes.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Is it reversible?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : It's unclear. It only works on people of a certain genetic disposition and the recipient must be induced into a comatose state for several days while their cells regenerate. The data indicates the only way to distinguish the real person from the double is by an ocular scan. A flaw in the iris was deliberately built into the procedure to tell them apart.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Free Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I've had two years of perspective! I am through letting Arvin Sloane control my life and I don't need your approval to resign! I told you as a courtesy!</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Well, then, I will pay you the courtesy of informing you that if you leave this agency, you forfeit the clearance to see your mother.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Free Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Ah... you must be the man that Sark told me about. The man that Sydney was willing to kill me for.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : She would have killed you for a lot less.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Free Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Marshall? I'm Michael Vaughn. Welcome to the CIA.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : [ <i>  smiles nervously </i> ] Heard that one before.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : [ <i>  smiles </i> ] Well, this time it's for real. [ <i>  gestures for Marshall to turn </i> ] We have a desk set up for you.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : [ <i>  turns </i> ] Syd!</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : How are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I'm fine, except every few moments I fight the urge to weep openly. But that's normal, right?</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Free Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Hello?</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Congratulations, Sydney. You have so many things to celebrate today. I, myself, am still coping with the pain and disappointment of learning that you and Jack were double agents. The two people I trusted most in the world.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You don't really think it was a coincidence that I happened to be away these past two weeks, do you? The intel that you acquired that allowed the CIA to take down the Alliance -- I provided that. My involvement with the Alliance is merely a means to an end.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Why are you telling me this?</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Because knowing that I'm alive is going to tempt you to come after me. Don't. We've helped set each other free, Sydney. And as much as I wish you well, I will end your life if you get in my way.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : <i>  [On the phone] </i> Our first honest conversation, Sydney, and you have nothing to say?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Listen to me, you son of a bitch! You have been a plague on my life. You repulse me! Every time I sat across from you, listening to your lies, all I could do was fantasize about slashing your throat!</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Free Agent
<dl><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : How long have you known?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Two years. I wanted to tell you so many times, but I was ordered not to. The CIA had no way to verify what I knew in my heart was true -- that you would never consider working for a man like Arvin Sloane.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : We were partners. You lied to me, then chose to tell me the truth when it was convenient for you. I never want to see you again.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Firebomb
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [to Sloane] </i> The CIA has a hit list. Thirty-five people worldwide its agents are allowed to kill. Thirty-five out of six billion. You're one of them. Which means when I kill you, I won't even be breaking the law.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Firebomb
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Can it wait?</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Apparently not, he wants Sydney too. Are you with her?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Uh ... No. I haven't seen her.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : You're in bed with her right now, aren't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I'm trying... just find out what he wants.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Firebomb
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You said everyone in the radius was affected, even people who were taking cover?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Yeah. Well, there's no defense against this kind of energy. It goes through walls, concrete, steel, everything.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : There's no shield.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : No. Sorry. Oh, um, I should probably also tell you that, um, this kind of energy knocks out computer circuitry. Which means if it's pointed at the sky, it could take down planes.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Firebomb
<dl><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : I'm out.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Sydney's in trouble.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : Respect my decision.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I can't do that. Not when your decision may cost Sydney her life. You wouldn't tell Sydney how you infiltrated Kabir's so she found an alternate way in using what turned out to be faulty intel. She was captured and unless we find another confirmed access point, no one will be sent in to get her out.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Dark Turn
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : We may never have a better chance to get Sloane. Remember, without Irina's help, the operation in Kashmir would have been an embarrassment.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Jack, when the hell did we switch places? Derevko could be using this operation just to convince us that she's trustworthy.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I've had twenty years to reflect on that woman's ability to deceive. Trust me. If she lies to me again, I'll know it.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Dark Turn
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : I wanted to see you because... it's going to be dangerous, setting this trap. I hope it goes well but there's no guarantee. So whatever happens, there's something I need you to know. Sydney, I love you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Mom--</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : You don't have to say anything. I'm pretty sure I haven't earned very much, and that's okay. This was just something I needed to say.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Dark Turn
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What is this about? I'd appreciate a little context here. You haven't even given me your name.</dd><dd> <b>  Yeager </b> : I'm Mitchell Yeager, I'm counter-intelligence threat analyst. That should give you a little context. I've been sent here to investigate Michael Vaughn. It's come to our attention that over the past three months, Mr. Vaughn has been in contact with a number of unapproved foreign operatives. He's also actively pursued contact with Mr. Pograski, who happens to be a former KGB assassin known to have ties with at least three terrorist organizations.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Listen to me, there is not a chance that he is a traitor, that he would be collaborating with an enemy.</dd><dd> <b>  Yeager </b> : You know, I knew your mother. About twenty years ago, met her with your father. We used to go to a lot of these agency functions, you know. She was, uh, charming. Very disarming woman... who wasn't what she seemed.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Dark Turn
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Look, there is something you don't know about me. I don't like it when people question my loyalty. It makes me insane.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : This isn't about loyalty. I never said anything about loyalty.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : When you ask me if I'm keeping secrets, the suggestion's pretty clear.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : And you know what? Secrets will be a problem between us. After everything we've been through, you should know that.</dd></dl>
Season 2
A Dark Turn
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Research? What kind of research?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : It's something private. Something just for me.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Who do you think you work for? Nothing is private. You're being investigated.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I had to find out if she was deceiving us again. I mean, I could not sleep at night knowing I was doing nothing. That somehow, I was helping her.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : And did you find anything?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Nothing. She's clean.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Truth Takes Time
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Your mother betrayed us. Betrayed the CIA. Her meeting with Sloane was staged to secure her escape.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You don't know that. Sloane could've set up the meet to abduct her.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Before the operation, she swapped the Rambaldi manuscript. She left us with a fake. She and Sloane are now in possession of the original. Sydney, they planned this.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Truth Takes Time
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : My mother's earrings. They found a note she left. She wanted me to have them. Just now, when my dad was telling me, the first thought I had was that she was dead, that she'd been killed. I had this whole thing in my head that she died proving herself a hero.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : No one can be blamed for trusting their own mother.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I wish she had been killed.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Truth Takes Time
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : I see through you. You must know that.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : This is who I am.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : You may need to think of yourself as an honorable husband, a father figure, but I don't. I will never see that man in you, which frankly is why we have this agreement.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You need to get some rest.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : Never talk to me about your love for Sydney again.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Truth Takes Time
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You were right to investigate her.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Sydney . . .</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : No, it's okay. It's the truth. I'm not blaming you, it's me. I was so naive about her.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I don't think you should be a part of this task force. Look, you know how I feel about Irina Derevko but no one should have to hunt down their own mother, no matter what the circumstances are.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Truth Takes Time
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [watching Emily on security camera footage] </i> She's alive?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : She walked through the front door, told the duty guard she is the wife of Arvin Sloane, that she wants to cooperate with the CIA and that she will only talk to you.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Endgame
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : This plan might not hold up. The CIA knows too much: they could guess why we were after the genetic database.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I'm not interested in the database. I want satellite footage of Tuscany. I want to know who murdered my wife.</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : We both had to make sacrifices, Arvin. You won't forgive yourself if you stop now. We're so close to knowing what Rambaldi knew.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I wish I never heard that man's name.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Endgame
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : I'm like anyone, Mr. Caplan. What I want is that which I never had.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Endgame
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Vaughn. I mean, okay. The backpack is getting a little ridiculous.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : What do you mean?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [she points to her bureau] </i> The middle drawer. It's yours.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : She gave you a drawer, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : It was a gesture of convenience.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : And, uh, what did you put in it?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Why do you care?</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : What do you mean, why do I care? Do you know how spoiled you are? You know, a drawer! I wish I had a girlfriend to say "Hey, do you want a drawer?"</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I'll give you a drawer at my place.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : I don't wanna drawer in your place.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : <i>  [to Vaughn] </i> If we end up sharing a cell in federal prison, I'm not giving you a drawer.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Endgame
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I'm not willing to risk your life based on speculative intel you acquired from a Russian spy.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Why would she lie?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : That's precisely the question!</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : She turned herself in!</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : She's not the first!</dd></dl>
Season 2
Endgame
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : We downloaded the DNA database Caplan decrypted from the computer he was working on. We finally have a lead on Sloane and Derevko.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Good. But, Sydney, if you go around me again I'll have you transferred and finding them will no longer be part of your job description.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Countdown
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I'm taking a leave. I want you to continue without me.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Sir, not to belittle your grief, but do not deny yourself the victory of a thirty-year pursuit.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : If I don't see you again, Mr. Sark, tell Irina that I hope you both succeed where I couldn't.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Countdown
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You're saying that five hundred years ago Rambaldi drew the DNA profile of a man who's alive today?</dd><dd> <b>  Kerry </b> : It gets even better. Di Regno's DNA profile was a code key. It let us decrypt page 94 of the Rambaldi manuscript.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : What's on the page?</dd><dd> <b>  Brandon </b> : Times and dates, each marking an apocalyptic event.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Countdown
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : There's a future date listed on the page, isn't there?</dd><dd> <b>  Brandon </b> : Forty-eight hours from now.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What's the prediction?</dd><dd> <b>  Kerry </b> : The page doesn't say, it just gives the time. It's the equivalent of midnight, eastern standard time.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Countdown
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I've worked with Agent Dixon for nearly a dozen years. You've worked with him for little over a month. If he feels ready to be in the field, I'm going to accord him that respect.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : But given his state of mind, do you really think he's the right person to make that decision?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Jack, he just lost his wife. I mean, with all due respect, why are you fighting with me on this?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I'm not required to justify my decisions to you, Agent Vaughn. However, I recruited Agent Dixon into SD-6. I'm the man who sold him the lie he was working for the CIA. I introduced him to the man who killed his wife. I will not be the one to tell him he can't assist in Sloane's capture.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Second Double
<dl><dd> <b>  Fake Francie </b> : <i>  [on the phone] </i> Will Tippin may be compromised.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Our superiors deal in absolutes. Either he is or he's not.</dd><dd> <b>  Fake Francie </b> : The CIA is on a mole hunt to find out who accessed the defense satellite communications system. It's only a matter of time before they trace it back to Tippin, and then to me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Second Double
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I have known Will for years. Trust me on this.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : There's another possibility... that the man we have in custody is not Will Tippin. Project Helix. The doubling prototype that you destroyed in Poland was designed to reshape a person's physical attributes to identically resemble someone else. The prototype's database revealed two scheduled recipients of the procedure: Dr. Markovic who was killed, and a second unknown individual.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You think Will is the double.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : We found Provacillium in Will's car. It's a medication usually taken by gene therapy patients to keep the body from rejecting the DNA mutations.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Second Double
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : If someone wanted to set Will up, this is exactly what they would do -- plant these clues, condition him. I'd like permission to assign Francie protective detail. If Sloane is targeting my friends, she could be next.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Done.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I'd also like to speak to her about Will. She might have information that could help.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Tell her what you think is necessary, but only what's necessary.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Second Double
<dl><dd> <i>  [Sloane joins Jack at his outdoor table at a restaurant.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : It's good to see you, Jack.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I assume that since you're sitting across from me with so little regard for your life, I'm in the cross hairs of a sniper rifle.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Two of them.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Second Double
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You erased it...</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : I transferred a copy to a secure location. I'll give it to you. In exchange, I want you to do something.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Go to hell!</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : If you don't, you'll never clear Will's name. He'll be tried as a traitor and executed. I'll be calling on you soon, Sydney.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Telling
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : We received a file, a DNA string, of the person who was doubled.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : And?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Your DNA didn't match and there was no Provacillium in your blood. You've been cleared.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Telling
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Allison... we can't reverse the process. Markovic's lab was destroyed. But we're doing everything we can to retrieve the lost data. And I'm hopeful that we will find a way to reverse the process.</dd><dd> <b>  Fake Francie </b> : I may have to stay this way?</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : No, no. We'll get you back.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Telling
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Get off the ledge now!</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : Sloane believes he's been chosen to realize the word of Rambaldi. But you, too, have been chosen.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : If you think I'm bluffing...</dd><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : It's you in the prophecy, Sydney, not me. Only you can stop him. Good luck, sweetheart. I love you.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Telling
<dl><dd> <b>  Will </b> : <i>  [whispering, leaving a message for Syd] </i> Sydney, it's me. Listen, this is going to sound insane but I just found Provacillium in the bathroom and I think that... I think that... uh, okay, just think about it. I think that the double is Franc-</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Telling
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : We thought you were dead. They asked me to come back to . . . to explain.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Come back from what? What are you talking about? <i>  [noticing his hand] </i> Vaughn... why are you wearing that ring?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Syd... since that night... you were missing. You've been missing for almost two years.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Two
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Where's my father? Or . . . or my mom - have you heard from her since Mexico City? Vaughn said Will's alive. If there was a fire in my apartment, if he thought I was dead, then how did Will survive? Where is he?</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : Sydney ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : And Francie - is she dead? Did they find her body, too?</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : I know you have a million questions, but ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I have a lot more than a million questions! I wish I only had a million questions!</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Two
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : They told me you were charged with resisting authority. Dad, I don't understand.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I became obsessed with your death; with finding those responsible. And at a certain point in my pursuit, I needed help. So I contacted the one person I believed I could trust, given the circumstances...your mother.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You were working with Mom?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : At the time, she was number 6 on the CIA's most wanted list. The National Security Council, primarily ... Robert Lindsey. You met him?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : He discovered that I was collaborating with your mother, so he threatened me, questioned my allegiance to this country. He chose to make an example of me - an NSC power play. And here we are.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Two
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Vaughn what?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : He got married.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Michael Vaughn is just a boy who was <i>  never </i> good enough for you.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Two
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You remember the Rambaldi device? The machine designed 500 years ago by a prophet? All I did was bring all the pieces together and have it assembled. And when I turned it on, it delivered a message, as I suspected it would. I wasn't prepared for what it said. The message was just one word, one simple word: peace. The epiphany I had at that moment . . . suddenly I saw all the mistakes I'd made, the pain I had inflicted on the world, the people I loved. So I chose right then and there to give information to the CIA with which they were able to dismantle at least two dozen terrorist cells.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I don't know how you convinced the CIA that you're trustworthy . . .</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Why don't you check my files?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know you too well. I don't buy any of it.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Two
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I came by to see how you were.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Are you kidding me?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : No, I just wanted to make sure that you're-</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You didn't come by to see how I am. You came by to see how you were, because you know what you did, you want to make sure you're okay.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I buried you. Consider that for one second.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Don't use rational thought as a defense with me, not after all you and I have seen. Vaughn, you and I live and breathe madness every day on the job. There is no rational thought. I can't pretend to have a conversation about anything else with you. What it comes down to is faith. What I was hoping you'd say was, "I gave up on us, I lost faith." But what you came here for was closure, and there is not a chance you are getting that from me. I'm not gonna say I understand. I'm not gonna sympathize with you, and tell you how hard this must be for you. But you wanna know how I am? I am horrible! Vaughn, I am ripped apart. And not because I lost you, but because if it had been me, I would've waited. I would've found the truth. I wouldn't have given up on you. And now I realize what an absolute waste that would've been.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Succession
<dl><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : <i>  [helping Sydney move] </i> You're sure you're okay with this? I mean, are you going to be all right? By yourself?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I just can't wrap my head around it. I mean, Francie's been dead for two years, but I feel like I saw her a few days ago. And now that Will is in the witness protection, I can't even contact him. All my friends are just . . . gone.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Not all your friends.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Succession
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [to Sloane] </i> Personally I would have found it anti-climactic that after expecting to assemble a weapon of ultimate power you found a revelation you could have acquired from a fortune cookie.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Succession
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : If I'm to understand what you're saying, you have no idea where you've been for the last two years. . . . None? . . . Unbelievable! I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh, it's just . . . I'm speechless. Sydney, if Sloane had intended to abduct you, I wasn't privy to it.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What if I said I still don't believe you?</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : I'd say it'd make no difference. In twenty-four hours I'll be free, and . . . you'll remain in the dark.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Succession
<dl><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Who the hell do you think you are!?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I'm the person who's going to hold you accountable if they kill him!</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Oh, you're going to hold <i>  me </i> responsible!?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Did I stutter?</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : If you're finished, this <i>  is </i> the men's room.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Who let you in?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Succession
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : The other day you said I gave up on us because I didn't have faith, that some how you didn't mean enough to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : When I said that I was...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : No - let me finish. After you died, I used to talk to you, like you were still around, literally out loud. Whole conversations about nothing: the weather, should I get a new car? should I have another drink? Then one day you started answering. I mean I could hear you in my head, like you were right next to me Sydney. We all know rationally I was a guy who stayed up nights, drinking, talking to his dead girlfriend. Still, I couldn't stop. So before you tell me that you can handle my coming back to the CIA, there are two things you need to know. First, is that I was so in love with you - it nearly killed me. And second, I don't regret moving on with my life.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Reunion
<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : The risks you are describing have already been factored into our analysis. And as for SD-6, the Alliance doesn't exist anymore . . .</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Well, the only reason that SD-6 and the Alliance broke down is because Arvin Sloane, a man the White House pardoned by the way, wanted them to! So do me a favor and don't revise history that I lived through!</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : All right, enough! Sark was an inch away from initiating a nuclear exchange, and that was only Phase One. Capturing Sark, while it might put a smile on my face, will do nothing to shut down the Covenant.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Reunion
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I haven't even asked anyone how they met.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Are you asking me? The NSC was wrapping up the case on your mom ...uh, we were all deposed ... Lauren was the one asking the questions. They hit it off.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Was everyone there? Dixon? Marshall . . .&#160;?</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Syd, she's a good person. I'm not trying to rub it in, but I ... I don't want to be dishonest.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Reunion
<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : We need access to the bunker; Sloane can get it for us. If we can use him, I don't see why we --</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Maybe you haven't been lucky enough to have firsthand experience with that psychopath . . .</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : She brokered his deal.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : I was part of the team that arranged for Sloane's pardon.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Look, none of us have any illusions about Sloane. The only reason he was given a pardon is because he provided us with intel that led to the destruction of terrorist cells ...</dd></dl>
Season 3
Reunion
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Mr. Vaughn. You know, I remember how close you were with Sydney. I'm sure you share my relief in having her back.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Reunion
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [to Sloane] </i> You've made your obligations clear, now let me clarify mine. I am obliged to extract immeasurable pain from you the moment you are no longer a valuable source of intel for the CIA. Personally, I hope you don't help us out...</dd></dl>
Season 3
A Missing Link
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : <i>  [to Lauren] </i> I must admit, I was concerned for you when Sydney resurfaced. I remembered seeing her with Vaughn: their relationship reminded me of my own with my late wife. It was the kind of bond that even death cannot sever. Hmmm. Well, apparently I misjudged.</dd></dl>
Season 3
A Missing Link
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I've never worked with anyone who can improvise better than you can . . . but when Simon called you Julia ... your reaction ... You didn't seem surprised.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Vaughn--</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : No. Tell me what's going on. Look, I know we're not where we were, but even before then, professionally, we never kept secrets from each other. I'm still on your side ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You're right: we're not where we were. And trust me when I tell you, I am doing you a favor by keeping you out of it.</dd></dl>
Season 3
A Missing Link
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Vaughn's been quizzing me about "Julia." I tried shutting down his inquiry, but apparently something you said has made that impossible.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : All I said was that I couldn't talk about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Which, of course, has only piqued his interest.</dd></dl>
Season 3
A Missing Link
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I can't afford to make a distinction between professional and personal - not in my life. I mean, this job took two years from me. Everything is personal.</dd></dl>
Season 3
A Missing Link
<dl><dd> <b>  Walker </b> : Tell me who the hell you're working for!</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I'm working for myself, you son of a bitch!</dd></dl>
Season 3
Repercussions
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : A member of Walker's team caught Michael; I still don't know how. Walker ID'd him as CIA --</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : -- and stabbed him and left him for dead. I already know all this. It's in the briefing. Thank you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Lauren, that's not . . . Walker had a gun to Michael's head. He was about to pull the trigger. I took his knife . . . I stabbed him myself.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Repercussions
<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : I don't know about you, but I can't work to the best of my abilities while wondering whether or not I'm being polite enough to my husband's ex-girlfriend.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You don't need to be polite with me. We're both past formalities.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : Then I'll be blunt. I want you to request a transfer to another field office.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know we're being blunt, but was that a threat? You don't have the authority to have me transferred.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : The NSC will support me, when they learn that our working together is compromising their fight against the Covenant.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Repercussions
<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : You've told Bomani you'd work for the Covenant?</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Yes. And now I'm telling you that I'm in the position to be a double agent. Working for the Covenant but loyal to the CIA ...What is it, Sydney?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [in disbelief] </i> This is classic ...</dd></dl>
Season 3
Repercussions
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Now as far as our technology can detect - and these are next gen tests, as high-end as it gets - he's not lyin', folks.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : If there's someone who can fool those tests, it's Sloane.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Yeah, well, in theory, yes. But in practice, he'd really have to be using the next gen's next gen lie detector defeating tech, which frankly, even I can't imagine.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Repercussions
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Okay. Just so someone has said it: in the past two years, Sloane has obtained a pardon based mainly on the capture of a criminal who is now free. In addition, Sloane will be allowed to openly participate in Covenant activities, based on the promise that he will inform us of those activities. One could argue that he's just pulled off the con job of the century.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : It also appears that Bomani will kill Sloane if we interfere with his plans.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : And who here would lose sleep over that?</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Nemesis
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I miss LA. I miss Emily. I miss the friendship with your father. <i>  [sighs] </i> I miss your confidence and trust. Perhaps, I can get it back someday?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You will never have my confidence and trust ... or my father's friendship and respect ... ever.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Nemesis
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : It's been three weeks since I learned that Sydney murdered Lazarey ... I've been lying to my wife for three weeks.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Vaughn, I know guys who've lied to their wives for a lot longer than that.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You understand that the reason your brother didn't like talking to you is because you say stupid things, right?</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Nemesis
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Sydney, I was very pleased when Dixon said you'd agreed to be my handler.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : It was an assignment, not an agreement - the way a janitor doesn't agree to clean a toilet. But as your handler, you'll do as I say, when I say it. I select your assignments; I design your missions. I control you, not the other way around.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Is that what you used to let Vaughn do? Control you?</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You will set up a meeting with Sark and Allison. You'll explain to them that their travel plans have been compromised. You'll then offer them assistance in revising their arrangements.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : And pass the information along to you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : That won't be necessary. You'll be wearing a wire.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : And if they discover that it's a setup?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Then I get to hear them kill you.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Nemesis
<dl><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : This is why people from the CIA should not get married to people from the NSC, man. Don't poop where you sleep...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Thanks a lot.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Prelude
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : By the way, you look beautiful.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Spare me.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You know, Sydney, we should dance.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Like hell.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : There was a time you trusted me.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : That was before I knew who you were . . . That was before I knew who <i>  I </i> was.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Prelude
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You killed Javier Perez, you son of a bitch!</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You've just returned from a traumatic experience, Mr. Vaughn. You're understandably emotional, which would explain your baseless accusation.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You're right, I am emotional. I get that way when I see a gun pressed to my wife's temple!</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Ours is a risky business.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : If you ever put my wife's life in danger again, I will kill you!</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Then perhaps you finally understand the moral compromises you'll make when someone you love is in danger.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Sloane gave you a key, which he claims was sent to him some time before you woke up in Hong Kong.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yeah, his claim was pretty convincing: it was written in my handwriting.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Remember when I told you that during the time you were missing, I contacted your mother? That cipher text was encoded using a method that she devised.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What does this mean? That I was in contact with Mom during the two years I was gone?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Prelude
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : If the NSC wants to find me, they will. Look, I was someone else for two years, Vaughn - someone I don't even remember. What am I supposed to do now? Spend the rest of my life in hiding?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Between that and a lobotomy, there isn't a choice!</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I can't keep running forever.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I'll do everything I can to make sure you won't have to.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Vaughn, why are you doing this? My life is already a disaster ... now yours is, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : What happened between us - everything. The way it is ... isn't anyone's fault, Sydney. And even though everything's changed, some things don't. I'm not gonna lose you twice.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Prelude
<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : Under authority of the National Security Council, Robert Lindsey has instructed me to relieve you of duty as director of this task force until he arrives to assume control.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : On what grounds?</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : Obstruction of justice. Willingly conspiring to impede an international investigation into the murder of Andrian Lazarey.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : These premises are to be locked down until Lindsey arrives with Federal Agents. That means, until such time, nobody leaves.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : I take it you have Sydney in custody.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : Not yet. But we know where she is.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Breaking Point
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : We're waiting for Sloane.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You called Sloane on this?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You and I will be the prime suspects behind any attempt to free Sydney from NSC custody. Sloane has agreed to make it seem as if it were the work of the Covenant. Do I trust him on this? Not necessarily.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Breaking Point
<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : But Sydney's made it very clear she doesn't remember anything.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : But when we searched her flat in Rome, we found a coded message taped to the underside of her desk. Now, if she can decode that message, it may help us infiltrate or even take down the Covenant.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : What if she doesn't recognize the code?</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : As long as she demonstrates a willingness to cooperate, that surgery will be nothing more than a threat.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : No, I'm sorry, but if I'm going to chronicle our treatment of Sydney Bristow, I need to see how she's being treated.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : How do you suppose it was that Sydney Bristow knew to flee the country before she was even aware the NSC wanted to take her into custody?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Breaking Point
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : The fact that you're letting me see this place means: it's not your only one, is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You're smarter than you look.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Breaking Point
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You and Sydney still believe I'm pursuing some hidden agenda. Now, whatever you may perceive that agenda to be, clearly it would be easier to obtain if you were both dead, given that you're my most vocal detractors - my most capable antagonists.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Or you need us for something. Something you believe only we can provide.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You and Sydney are my absolution, my penance. You're all I have left.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Breaking Point
<dl><dd> <b>  Campbell </b> : <i>  [to Sydney] </i> Your personality profile reveals your one major weakness: empathetic suffering is harder for you to sustain than physical torture. So ... thanks for caring.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You better make sure I'm a vegetable when you're done with me...</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conscious
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : What happens if what we're looking for isn't metal?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Then we're screwed; it isn't an unfamiliar situation.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conscious
<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : I know how hard this might be for you ...</dd><dd> <i>  [Sydney punches her.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : That was for turning me in to Lindsey.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conscious
<dl><dd> <b>  Brazzel </b> : Be aware that if you encounter a new memory, it might be traumatic.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : But it won't necessarily be real.</dd><dd> <b>  Brazzel </b> : Oh, it will be to you.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Conscious
<dl><dd> <i>  <b>   Sydney  </b>  : I can't help it, I just miss you. I do. </i></dd><dd> <i>  <b>   Vaughn  </b>  : You know we can't do this. </i></dd><dd> <i>  <b>   Sydney  </b>  : Give me a break, it's a dream - we can do whatever we want. At least, I can. </i></dd></dl>
Season 3
Conscious
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You're sure the DNA matched Lazarey's?</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : Yes. Which means that Sydney did not kill him - Lindsey has nothing on her. She can come home.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Remnants
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : If you betray her, I swear to you no matter what it costs me, I will kill you.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : No need to worry, Agent Vaughn. I love her too.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Remnants
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I didn't bring this up to start a petty fight. The fact is, you and I have something in common. We both suffered through the death of the woman we loved only to discover that she was still alive. I know, it's hard. But this isn't about you. And I will not allow my daughter to become your mistress.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : If that's where you think my concern for Sydney is headed, then you are even more cynical than I thought.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : If lightning strikes, Mr. Vaughn, and you and I get to walk free again, if you care about my daughter as you claim to, then push her away. Be cruel if you have to. Make her despise you because your kindness tortures her. I can see it, what it does to her. And I won't have it.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Remnants
<dl><dd> <b>  Hotel Clerk </b> : Checking in?</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : <i>  [in a British accent, dressed as a rock star] </i> Of course. I'm here, she's here. We made it.</dd><dd> <b>  Hotel Clerk </b> : And you are ...&#160;?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : We're the next big thing.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : It was a little over the top.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Over the top? I'm wearing seat covering, there is no "over the top."</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : You have to admit, my accent was pretty good. It was, like, early Stones.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I thought it was Australian.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Remnants
<dl><dd> <b>  Will </b> : I thought if I had the chance, ending her life would be satisfying. You know, there'd be closure ... It's just as empty as the dreams. It's horrible. There's no ... satisfaction. There's nothing.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Full Disclosure
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You're part of this?</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Well, that all depends on which part you're referring to.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You're Covenant.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : No, no, no. That wouldn't go over too well at home.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Full Disclosure
<dl><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : We need to talk about the past two years.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : As you may be aware, Mr. Kendall, I have no recollection of that time.</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : But I do.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You've known all this time . . .</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Yep.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Then why haven't you said anything?</dd><dd> <b>  Kendall </b> : Because you asked me not to.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Full Disclosure
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Can you locate the cube?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Well, no, not exactly, but I can narrow it down to a ten-yard radius.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Marshall, that's called locating it.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Full Disclosure
<dl><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : The day you showed up in Rome - when you called in - they put you through to Kendall? I was there that day, in the office. When he hung up, he told me that it was you. Sydney, I've known the truth about what happened to you, and I was ordered to say nothing.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Dixon, we've been working together for months.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : It's not easy, is it? Keeping the truth from someone you love. Now I have an idea what it was like for you at SD-6.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You're coming with us?</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : Of course I am: it's personal for me too.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Crossings
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I've done everything I can to try to make this ridiculous situation work. You, me and Lauren working in the same office--</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Yeah, and I have tried to walk around with this fake smile on my face, pretending everything was fine, just the way it use to be. That's not working for me anymore.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : This is it. When we get back, one of us has to go.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Crossings
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [to Vaughn] </i> Have I offended you in some way, like showing up and disrupting the perfect little life you had?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Crossings
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Tell me, which of Irina's sisters are you? Elena or Yekatarina?</dd><dd> <b>  Katya </b> : I haven't been Yekatarina since I was a child. My sisters call me Katya. Which means Irina wasn't the one who told you about me.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Learning that your wife is actually a Russian spy drives you to learn all you can about her true identity.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Katya </b> : As observant as you are, you were married to my sister for five years without suspecting who she really was: her love must have been intoxicating.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Crossings
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : <i>  [to Jack] </i> I remember years ago, I was working at SD-6. I was on my way to a meeting in Berlin. It was a typical day - except K-Directorate made an attempt on my life. As I opened my car door, a sniper shot came out of nowhere. The bullet grazed my neck. Actually left a burn mark. . . . You never forget what that feels like - to barely escape with your life.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Crossings
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : We're not gonna make it out of here. There's something I need you to know.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Vaughn...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : In my life, there's only one person...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Don't do this.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Look at me.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Vaughn...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : The only reason I pushed you away...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Please...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : The only reason I didn't know how to be around you...</dd><dd> <i>  [hear marching] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : They're coming.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Sydney...</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know, Vaughn. I know. We'll find each other. We always find each other.</dd></dl>
Season 3
After Six
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Do you think you can be in love with two people at the same time?</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : No, I don't. However I did have the same intense feelings for both Sporty and Posh Spice.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Yeah, who didn't?</dd></dl>
Season 3
After Six
<dl><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> : I want us to be to married before the baby is born.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : What? We haven't got a minister!</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : It's okay! I can ordain you over the Internet.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : By the power invested in me by the, er, United Church of... Mammals, I now pronounce you man and wife.</dd><dd> <i>  [Marshall and Carrie get married] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I love you Mrs. Flinkman.</dd><dd> <b>  Carrie </b> : I'm keeping my name.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Okay.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : <i>  [to Sydney] </i> I see what's going on between you and Michael, so let me be clear. Stay the hell away from my husband.</dd></dl>
Season 3
After Six
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Every day I wish I could go back in time, but I can't. And as much as I... as much as I still have feelings for you, I won't be the other woman - not ever.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I know.</dd></dl>
Season 3
After Six
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : <i>  [to Barnett] </i> I manipulate people. I'm good at that, and I know it. I lie. I keep secrets. I divulge only what I must in order to elicit the reaction I need. That skill, in part, is why I'm still alive. One of those secrets affects the only two people I care about in the world, Sydney and Jack Bristow. There are many secrets I enjoy keeping. There is power in secrets that you keep. But this one . . . no. This one wears on me. It has for many years. It's central to my very existence. It's who I am.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blowback
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yesterday was the day, wasn't it? The anniversary of your father's death?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : How could you remember that?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I remember what missing him does to you.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blowback
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [to Lauren] </i> Vaughn and I have a history, a complicated one - I can't deny that, but I won't apologize for it either. If your marriage is in trouble, if you and Vaughn are having problems, I suggest you leave me out of it and take it up with your husband.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blowback
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : It looks like another black mark on your husband's record. How's it feel to systematically ruin a man from the inside out?</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : It wouldn't be the first time.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blowback
<dl><dd> <b>  Barnett </b> : Are you telling me Sydney is your daughter?</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I never tried to prove it, one way or the other. But the strength that Sydney finds within, I like to believe that comes from me. . . How about that: the world didn't come to an end.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blowback
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : <i>  [on the phone] </i> It killed you, didn't it? Seeing him drop the gun for Sydney.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : No it isn't a good time. Can I call you in the morning?</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : He's there with you, is that it? Though he'd rather be with her. You know, it's quite a charade you two are engaged in.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Facade
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Actually, Ryan alerted local authorities, gave them time to evacuate the building.</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : So he's a humanitarian bomber?</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : He wanted the bomb squad called in?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Well, maybe because he knew there was nothing they could do.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Facade
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I still think it would just be easier to sic your father on him.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : We have twenty-seven hours before Ryan sets off another bomb. Our best chance to prevent that is to let him know that his first demonstration convinced us to buy every weapon he can produce.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Us, being the Covenant, based on intel received from someone we may or may not be able to trust.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Facade
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Your product demonstration in Belfast was impressive: we'd like to purchase your new weapon.</dd><dd> <b>  Ryan </b> : Yeah. While I appreciate ... your hairstyle ... as I said, I do business with Andrejev.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Facade
<dl><dd> <b>  Lisenker </b> : Sark has never met Ryan.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Are you sure of this?</dd><dd> <b>  Lisenker </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : That wasn't a "yes," that was a "no."</dd></dl>
Season 3
Facade
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Doesn't it bother you?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : What's that?</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : A bombmaker arranges for a meeting on a plane and then doesn't show up. I don't know about you, but that concerns me.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Taken
<dl><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : The intelligence committee is sending Senator Reed to oversee the interrogation.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Why the sudden interest from Washington?</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : Sark is a key player now. They expect us to bleed him dry.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Taken
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I enhanced the audio, and it turns out our friend Mr. Sark made a phone call.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : <i>  [on recording] </i> Notify the extraction team. I should be at the LZ on schedule. Do we have the hostages? ... Excellent ... Not if I see you first, love.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Taken
<dl><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : The emotional toll this has taken and my current state of mind convince me I am no longer the best guarantee of her return. Therefore, I am stepping down temporarily as director of this task force until this matter is resolved. Jack, I trust you will stand in my stead and do everything in your power to bring my daughter back to me.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Taken
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : I'm afraid I'm going to need some insurance to guarantee I reach my extraction point safely. This collar contains a lethal cardiotoxin. Once I place this on your daughter, you'll have two minutes to disarm it before the compound is released into her system.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : You son of a bitch! That was not part of our agreement!</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : This mechanism is well within your disarming capabilities. Two minutes is generous, in my opinion.</dd></dl>
Season 3

<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : See you later.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : Not if I see you first, love.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You have such a beautiful smile, Sydney. I miss it.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : If you're executed, I'll be a witness. I'll smile then.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Frame
<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Have you been made?</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : <i>  [about Vaughn] </i> Of course not. If he knew I was Covenant he would arrest me, not break up with me.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Frame
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : All I have is a paper trail. Not definitive proof but the beginning of what Director Dixon and I believe to be a strong case for the existence of a mole.</dd><dd> <b>  Senator Reed </b> : Other than Sloane.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Or instead of him. At this point, that is unclear.</dd><dd> <b>  Senator Reed </b> : Is it that hard to identify a traitor? Honestly, sometimes I think you people just get too close.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Frame
<dl><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : We've looked everywhere on Earth.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Really, Marcus? Have you? Or is it simply that you've looked everywhere on land?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Unveiled
<dl><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : <i>  [about Vaughn] </i> You know, Syd, nobody would blame you for hating him for going back to her.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : He's not the one I hate. How horrible does that sound?</dd><dd> <b>  Weiss </b> : Well <i>  I'm </i> mad at her, and I don't even think he's that cute.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Unveiled

Season 3
Unveiled
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Lauren, no one's judging you.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : I've seen the way they look at me - like I'm a traitor too. To tell you the truth, I don't blame them.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : People are just angry.</dd><dd> <b>  Lauren </b> : And I'm not? He was my father! You have no idea what it's like to think you know someone, to love them, and then figure out it was nothing but lies.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : We should talk to Dixon and figure out a way to handle this.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Oh, I know how to handle this.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You will act like nothing has changed.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Okay, what's Plan B 'cause that's not going to happen.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : My wife betrayed me. She betrayed all of us. You can't expect me to pretend that never happened.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I'm not sure you have a choice.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Why is that?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Because you're the one that married her.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Hourglass
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : If Sloane dies, any chance I have of finding my sister dies with him.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Has it occurred to you that your half-sister might be a danger to you?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yes of course. But it's equally possible that I can help her. She could be an innocent victim.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : With Irina Derevko and Arvin Sloane as her parents, I don't think so.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Hourglass
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Irina betrayed both of us, Jack. She sought me out for information the same way she did you.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : She was my wife.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : She was a KGB spy who cared nothing about you or me. I've always thought that you understood your relationship with Irina was nothing more than that. But now that your schoolboy crush on the woman who destroyed your life is preventing you from saving mine, I will have to revise that assessment.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Hourglass
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [to Sloane] </i> You're right. I'm not going to help you. Since this is the last conversation we will ever have, I want to make this perfectly clear. What you have done to my daughter is nothing compared to what I will do when I find yours. Salut.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Hourglass
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : <i>  [before his execution] </i> For you who pay witness, I can only believe there is a common thought amongst you all: "This is as it should be." I do not disagree. My only request: that if my daughter is in fact found alive, that she understand my actions, she understand that this day's events are the net result of her father's passion to find her, to know her, to love her.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blood Ties
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Sydney, whatever grief my apparent death might have caused you, I only wish I could have spared you the pain.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : When I heard you were dead, any grief I felt was over the possibility of never knowing my sister. I did not grieve for you.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blood Ties
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : After mom died, I used to have these daydreams. I would imagine her leading my girl scout troop or taking me shopping for new school clothes. I thought if only she'd lived, she would have been my best friend. When I learned the truth about her, and saw Irina for who she truly was, I was devastated. I won't make the same mistake twice.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Blood Ties
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Sydney, there's something you should know. When I first learned of Sloane's affair with your mother, I was forced to consider the possibility that I wasn't in fact your biological father.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You don't even--</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : It's not the case. I had our medical files examined. Our relationship is clear. But I wanted you to know, during that brief time before I was reassured my feelings for you never changed.</dd></dl>
Season 3

<dl><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : I'll ask you again: where is the Passenger?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Holding that thing ... you almost look like you've reached puberty.</dd></dl>

Blood Ties
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Your sister - you have to let her go.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You're tired. I should let you sleep.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : No. My father was killed because he took her from the KGB. He hid her from your mother. That's why she murdered him. I met someone who told me the prophecy. The Passenger and the Chosen One shall battle; neither will survive.</dd></dl>

Legacy
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael Vaughn </b> : Whatever Lauren did to me, I want you to know I take full responsibility for what's happened. I messed up, and if you can't get past that, I understand. But will you try?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I don't know.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Will you at least think about it? Because it's all I can think about.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yeah. I will think about it.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Legacy
<dl><dd> <b>  Nadia </b> : <i>  [to Sloane] </i> Every Sunday at the orphanage in San Telmo, they made us dress up in our finest clothes. They would have us stand in line for hours waiting to be chosen by families. I wouldn't do it. I'd make myself filthy and always frown. I didn't want to be chosen, because I knew . . . I knew that somewhere my dad was still looking for me. And one day he'd come to take me away from that place . . . If I had known it was you I was waiting for, I would have cleaned up.</dd></dl>
Season 3

<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I know why you checked yourself out of medical services early. I know you're under the impression you're fine, that all you need to do is hold yourself together, bury yourself in work.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Get to the point, Jack.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I suggest you focus your energy into achieving closure on this matter.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : No one wants Lauren in custody more than I do!</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : That's not the kind of closure I'm referring to.</dd></dl>

As Nadia acclimates to this life, to a new family... she needs support... and you have put my mind at ease.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : The thought that I did something that might have given you a warm and fuzzy feeling makes me want to kick my own sister out of my house.</dd></dl>

Ice
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [to Nadia] </i> Irina told me years ago that this is a picture of her holding her niece. She told me that holding this baby filled her with a longing and a hope to have children of her own. The next day I asked Irina to marry me; I wanted my child to be loved like the baby in this photograph. Of course, her story could have been a total fabrication, another one of her countless lies designed to draw me in. But I choose to believe it was truth. When we had Sydney, Irina held her in this exact same way, and I can only imagine that she did the same with you. So for me, I choose to believe. But than I suppose each of us needs to find our own sense of closure.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I was married for a short time... The woman I was married to betrayed me, she betrayed a lot of people. And when I found out what she'd done, I let my hate for her consume me, I began to wish the woman I loved was dead. I woke up every day imagining how I'd do it, what was the best way, what was the most efficient way. It's all I wanted. That woman was evil and deserved to be punished and so I killed her. And although that woman was the worst kind of evil I also know that killing her was wrong. I don't sleep much, I can't. I can't close my eyes without seeing it, that moment, the look on her face. She won't leave me. She won't.</dd></dl>

Admit it.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : No, Sydney, Sydney, listen to me. What are you scared of?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I am scared. Scared you're gonna betray me again.

But before we begin whatever inquisition you're here for, there is a pesky question that's been lingering in my head. Do you mind?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Go ahead.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Was it the infidelity or the espionage that motivated you to kill the woman I loved?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : The woman you loved?</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Yes. Loved. You know, she once actually told me that she longed to love you... but the mundane existence you provided couldn't hold a candle to my passion.</dd><dd> <i>  [Vaughn punches him] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : That wasn't for sleeping with the woman I was married to.

Now with regards to your previous request. I will help you locate CRF leadership. But as always, you must do something for me in return.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Why the charade?

Eliminate her.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : And what about your faith that Nadia will survive?</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Oh... this isn't about faith.</dd></dl>
Season 4
A Man of His Word
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Does this make you feel better, watching this happen?</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : It gives me hope that I can still achieve closure.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Guys like you don't believe in closure. That would actually require you to care about something.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : Perhaps that's true. Perhaps all I can hope for is a moment for us all to share. You, me, her. And letting go of all pretexts and subterfuge, we can finally admit the truth. Your wife loved me. Not even death can change that. Do it. Open it.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : You want your moment? Take it.</dd><dd> <i>  [Lauren's coffin is opened and Sark begins to unzip the cover over her chest, to see her bullet wounds] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Stop.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : My agreement, Mr. Vaughn, allows for this. A perfect triangular pattern, consistent with CIA training. It was you. You did this.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Yes, I did.</dd><dd> <b>  Sark </b> : I'll take you to CRF. But I want you to face what you did. I want you to look at her.</dd></dl>

Season 4
The Index
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : The Chinese have a saying: "Once joy scatters a thousand griefs." So it is in that spirit that I wish you, Nadia, the same joy that you bring to me every day.

Season 4
Tuesday
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Not really a policy, per se. More of a been-burned-by-too-many-fly-by-night-terrorists-to-trust-them sort of thing. You know, one day they say, 'We'll pay gold,' the next they say, 'Did we say gold? We meant goats--'"</dd></dl>

Approach the second one gently, like a soft-boiled egg. You're going to need a digging instrument to assist with this.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I've got a spork.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : What's a spork?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : It's like a half-spoon... half-fork, will that do?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : That will work.</dd></dl>

Prophet Five
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I always liked the name Owen.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : Owen.

Prophet Five
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : He's not gonna find Sydney and Vaughn, not from what I gave him. I encrypted Vaughn's files, 4096-bit - it'll take him years. I mean, he's an ass. Deal with it.</dd></dl>
Season 5
...1...
<dl><dd> <b>  Renee </b> : You're gonna want to step aside now.</dd><dd> <b>  Guard </b> : Sexy. So I'm being threatened by a waif and a pregnant chick.</dd><dd> [ <i>  Renee punches him and shoves him against the door. </i> ]</dd><dd> <b>  Renee </b> : Is it sexy now?</dd></dl>
Season 5
...1...
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I understand why you're reluctant. You're number eight on the CIA's most wanted list, I get it. But you have to understand: these people killed my fiance, the father of my child. I'm going to enlist every resource available to immobilize them, and if that means that this is the last time you and I see each other, that is fine by me. Just tell me how you want to do it.</dd><dd> <b>  Renee </b> : Number eight?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Renee </b> : I'm slipping. Used to be number six . . . You're exactly like Michael said you were.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You called him "Michael."</dd><dd> <b>  Renee </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> [ <i>  She turns to leave. </i> ]</dd><dd> <b>  Renee </b> : Don't worry. He was crazy about you.</dd></dl>
Season 5
...1...
<dl><dd> <b>  Curtis </b> : No deal. I'm not talking. . . . [ <i>  He looks at Sydney's belly. </i> ] . . . Sorry, Baby. Daddy just went snooping where he shouldn't have gone.</dd></dl>
Season 5
...1...
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Do you recognize me?</dd><dd> <b>  Curtis </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Four months ago, you murdered a man, Michael Vaughn. Do you remember? I do. I was there. It'll be burned into my memory for the rest of my life as the day my child lost its father . . . So you can imagine what I'd like to do to you. Lucky for you, there's someone I want even more. Tell me where I can find Gordon Dean.</dd><dd> <b>  Curtis </b> : Is this whole routine supposed to scared me? I-I do this for a living.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : It's a funny thing about pregnancy - hormones. Whoo. I woke up today... [ <i>  she gives Curtis a dark, threatening look </i> ] ...feeling pretty hormonal.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Shed
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Take a look right there. See? That - those vials? That's a nerve agent called Substance 33; it was developed by the Russians during the Cold War - remarkable stuff. You know, in an... end of... civilization... sort of way.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Shed
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You're scared. You should be. No one is coming to rescue you.</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : I am an operative for the U.S. Government, so unless you want to start a war with the CIA I would suggest--</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Here's your next problem, Rachel: we're CIA.</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : Well, then this must be some . . . big misunderstanding. If you're CIA, we're on the same side.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> <i>  (to Grace) </i> : Call Langley and verify her story.</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : You can't. We're off-book, black ops. Langley won't verify us.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Well, that's convenient.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Shed
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [to Rachel] </i> I want to tell you a story. Just stop me if I get something wrong. You were approached in college, someplace public - the quad or walking to class. A man asked you if you wanted to serve your country. When he told you it was for the CIA, you just, you couldn't believe it. But you took the tests, and they were easy for you; they made you feel good about yourself. You probably started work at a false front, some phantom company that had you doing entry-level analysis . . . Maybe you wondered why you were never sent to Langley. Maybe you wondered why you weren't being trained with other recruits. Then you got promoted.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Shed
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Dean took you under his wing. He convinced you that you were so important, you just had to be out there, helping him save the world. How am I doing?</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : You read my file.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : No, I didn't. Thirteen years ago, the same thing happened to me. Only I had been lied to. What I was told was the CIA was in reality a criminal organization. I think you've been told the same lie.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Mockingbird
<dl><dd> <b>  Tom </b> : They're ready for us. We got to go.</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : Do you want to come over here and do the advanced binomial calculus?

Season 5
Mockingbird
<dl><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : How can you people sleep after something like this?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : You just learn to take it where you can get it, I guess.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Out of the Box
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You seem to be enjoying your freedom.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I was hoping to offer you more than prison food.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I must confess I'd grown rather fond of the shepherd's pie... I'm assuming you didn't bring me here simply for the cuisine.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Solo
<dl><dd> <b>  Tom </b> : You okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : If by "okay" you mean "freaked and embarrassed," then yeah, I'm great.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Peyton </b> : You should've given me the disk!</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : You were gonna kill me anyway.</dd><dd> <b>  Peyton </b> : Yeah... but I woulda felt bad about it. Now it's gonna be fun.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Fait Accompli
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : He suspects it's an access key for a secure network.</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : So, we just have to find out which network. Well, luckily there are only ten billion secure networks in the world.</dd></dl>

Fait Accompli
<dl><dd> <i>  [Rachel has just knocked down Gordon Dean] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> <i>  [on comms] </i> : What's he doing?</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : Eating dirt. I just hit him with a shovel.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : A shovel? Is he conscious?</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : Yeah, I think so.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Then hit him again.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Fait Accompli
<dl><dd> <b>  Ehrmann </b> : There are a few more things we need you to do for us.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : We have a deal.</dd><dd> <b>  Ehrmann </b> : No. We have an arrangement, which you don't seem to understand very well.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You son of a bitch.</dd><dd> <b>  Ehrmann </b> : I'll be in touch. Til then, I want you to remember one thing: you have something now that you didn't have this morning.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : What's that?</dd><dd> <b>  Ehrmann </b> : Hope.</dd></dl>
Season 5

Season 5
Bob
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Sounds awesome!</dd><dd> <i>  [Jack and the others look at him.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Well, Brazil.

Season 5
Bob
<dl><dd> <i>  [Rachel stops as she's about to cut another wire.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : <i>  [to Sark] </i> Just so we're clear: you approached me. You were the one that was stupid enough to let me into your room, and afterwards, you were the one that wanted to cuddle.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Horizon
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You should know, when it comes to Vaughn ... I take it quite personally.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I know, Dad.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : We're going to fix this.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Horizon
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Desantis </b> : So this is how you do it. Bring in a man in a suit to scare me into talking.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You're right. The suit shouldn't scare you. What should scare you... is that I'm a very concerned father.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Horizon
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Desantis </b> : You can't do anything to me now. I'm quite prepared to die.</dd><dd> <i>  [Jack gives Renee the gun.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : See if he means it.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Horizon
<dl><dd> [ <i>  while Sydney is under hypnosis </i> ]</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Wait a minute; don't tell me you cook.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : There are a lot of things about me you don't know.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Do you clean, too?</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I've been known to. Why? Are you thinking of hiring me?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Why would I hire you when I got you for free?</dd></dl>

Season 5
Maternal Instinct
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I can fend for myself.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : But you're not just fending for yourself, you're fending for two. (Glances at Syd) Let's be honest Syd, right now you waddle.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I don't waddle.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : Oh ho ho, yes you do.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I'll admit that I'm maybe less graceful, but I don't waddle.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : You're right, (Syd scoffs) it's more like a teeter.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Maternal Instinct
<dl><dd> <b>  Irina </b> : You should know something, Sydney. I never wanted to have a child. The KGB demanded it. They knew it would insure your father allegiances to me. You were simply a mean to an end. And when the doctor put you in my arms, and I looked at you, so fragile. All I could think was I could have made a such terrible mistake, and at that moment I was sure of one thing&#160;: I couldn't be an agent and a mother. And I failed at one of both. And I chose to fail at being a mother.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Maternal Instinct

<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You do not leave edged weapons within the reach of children.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : She's four weeks old, Dad.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Particularly young Bristow women.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : She can't even hold her head up. I think we're safe.</dd></dl>
Season 5
There's Only One Sydney Bristow
<dl><dd> <b>  Rance </b> : <i>  [to Sydney] </i> With your permission, Ma'am, we'd like to go through the house, baby-proof it from top to bottom. Socket protectors, safety latches, gates on stairs. Spread-spectrum RF protectors, perimeter sensors, explosive sniffers. All the usual stuff.</dd></dl>
Season 5
There's Only One Sydney Bristow
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Hopefully she won't even know I've been gone.</dd><dd> <b>  Rance </b> : Oh, no. The mother-child bond is impossible to replicate, even by Agent Dalton and myself.</dd></dl>
Season 5
There's Only One Sydney Bristow
<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : We were talking about what happened. We have to assume you were grabbed because someone was trying to hurt me.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Well, yeah. I didn't think they wanted me for all the Lakers statistics I have in my head.</dd></dl>
Season 5
There's Only One Sydney Bristow
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : There's some good news. Looks like the charge is small enough that the blast will be localized.</dd><dd> <b>  Will </b> : Wait- wait. So it might not kill me?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : No, it'll definitely kill you. There just won't be any collateral damage.</dd></dl>
Season 5
30 Seconds
<dl><dd> <b>  Nadia </b> : <i>  [referring to Rambaldi's Page 47] </i> You have to choose, me or this.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : You can't ask me to choose between the two most important things in my life.</dd><dd> <b>  Nadia </b> : Then I guess you'll lose us both. <i>  [Throws the page into the fireplace] </i></dd></dl>
Season 5
30 Seconds
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : A few days ago I was absolutely horrified that you would suggest I would turn against APO. That I would kill my own daughter. I realize now that both were inevitable. That death is a necessary sacrifice. Necessary to complete the final leg of this journey. I have been preparing for this my whole life. I knew it was coming. I have betrayed everyone I ever loved. But I was chosen.</dd></dl>
Season 5
I See Dead People
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : What I am about to say is not to leave this room. Agent Vaughn is alive.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I knew it! I knew he couldn't be dead...!</dd></dl>

Apparently I'm funny.</dd></dl>
Season 5
No Hard Feelings
<dl><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : <i>  [to Isabelle] </i> Gonna be just like your mom, aren't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Oh, I hope not. I hope she's a ... doctor, or a teacher, or just anything that does not involve wearing a wig.</dd><dd> <b>  Vaughn </b> : I don't know... I think that she'd look cute in a little pink wig. <i>  [Isabelle rolls over] </i> Maybe not. <i>  [Isabelle starts to snore. Vaughn laughs.] </i> Oh my god, the snoring, that just kills me.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Reprisal
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : What's that, a garrote? You carry a garrote?</dd><dd> <b>  Rachel </b> : It's an underwire. Sometimes it pays to be a girl.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : <i>  [after seeing the guard coming to execute them] </i> Um, um, Rachel! <i>  [to the guard] </i> Please, don't shoot me. I have a family, a wife and a child. We're hoping to having another one, maybe a girl?</dd><dd> <i>  [Rachel beats the guard up] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : That was the coolest thing I've ever seen! Seriously, that was, like, <i>  Empire Strikes Back </i> cool!</dd></dl>

Season 5
Reprisal
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Don't be difficult. Think about your son . . . Marshall, you're not cut out for this.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : You know, I never liked you. I tolerated you because I had to. You know, because you were my superior. And I was afraid of you. I saw how twisted you were . . . But now I see you for who you really are. You are a weak, pathetic man. You know, you're right. I'm not cut out for this. But I am thinking about my son. I want Mitchell to look up to me, to be proud of his dad. Which is why, no matter what you do to me? I'll never help you. I got a hangnail right there, on my thumb? You mind working on that one next?"</dd></dl>
Season 5
Reprisal
<dl><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : I'm doing what needs to be done.</dd><dd> <b>  Nadia </b> : Does that help you sleep at night?</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Marshall and Rachel will do what I ask.</dd><dd> <b>  Nadia </b> : No. They won't.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : Why not?</dd><dd> <b>  Nadia </b> : Because they have something you don't.</dd><dd> <b>  Sloane </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Nadia </b> : Love. Family. Honor. Take your pick. That's why you'll never break them.</dd></dl>

Season 5
All the Time in the World
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Yes, you can. I-I never wanted this life for you. I never wanted you to bear this kind of responsibility. But you were a very difficult little girl. You-you were far too driven, far too strong to let someone like me stop you from becoming who you are.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Dad. The medical team is coming. So if you'll just sit tight...</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Sydney listen to me. There's no one in this world who can do the things that you can do. I can hold out until help arrives, but you have to go. You have to stop your mother.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : Ok. I'll um just ok. Just keep applying pressure because you can't afford to lose more blood.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Just get moving.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : I love you Dad. And I don't want to leave you here.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I love you Sydney. Go.</dd></dl>

Low-risk insertion. Simple alias. Who knows. Could be fun.</dd><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : That's what you say every time you show up on my doorstep. And the next thing you know, I'm jumping over canals in three-inch heels while Napalm explodes around me.</dd><dd> <b>  Dixon </b> : Yes. That's how I define "fun."</dd></dl>
