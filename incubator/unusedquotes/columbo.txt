Columbo </b> : Uh, it's your mail.</dd><dd> <b>  Ken Franklin </b> : My mail?</dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : Isn't it funny how people are different? Now, me, if I found my partner dead I'd never think of opening my letters.</dd><dd> <b>  Ken Franklin </b> : But I-I-I just did it to distract myself. I mean you gotta remember one thing.

Brilliant!</dd><dd> <b>  Ken Franklin </b> : Are you awarding gold medals today?</dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : Yes! For the first one, not for the second one. That was sloppy.

<dl><dd> <b>  Arthur Kennicut </b> : What would you have done if the car hadn't broken down? You couldn't set up this trap.</dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : Well, I guess we would have found some other way. You know what this place reminds me of, just seeing all these cars? You know, in our neighborhood we had a bunch of jokers. I mean we were a real loud bunch of guys and we figured out a perfect way to put a car out of commission. You take a potato, you stick it in the exhaust pipe. Doesn't cause any damage but the car won't start. It was a terrible thing to do. And I got a feeling that the reason I became a cop was to make up for all those jokes I played when I was a kid.</dd></dl>

Wait until you get an attorney. This way you can hurt your case. Believe me, I know something about my business. I don't know nothing about golf, you know. See, that's your business. I know something about my business. And believe me, you know, down through the years, uh, you get so that you, uh, you develop a nose for things, you see, and, uh, makes a perfect golf shot after a while the ol' nose just tells you when someone is not giving you the truth.

And besides, the burglar alarm thing, you know, there's only one way to really beat that, is if you have somebody else from the inside open the door.</dd><dd> <b>  Dale Kingston </b> : I don't think I understand.</dd><dd> <b>  Lt.

I guess that's what started me wondering.</dd><dd> <b>  Paul Hanlon </b> : I did what?</dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : You turned the radio down but not quite off. When I told you that Eric Wagner was dead. It's alright. I do the same thing. You know, when I'm listening to the game and my wife interrupts, I can't help myself.

Columbo </b> : Well, whatever it is, it sure must be most unusual. Uh, the reason I say that is because, you know, when my wife and I try to remember what happened yesterday or the day before, well, we don't agree on anything.

Columbo </b> : September 15, the day before. That was the day your husband disappeared. Now it starts to make some sense. I have a possible explanation for why the fountain doesn't run.

Season Two
A Stitch in Crime[2.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : You were both nurses, is that right?</dd><dd> <b>  Marsha Talbot </b> : Yes, but Sharon always was devoted to healing. She always worked in hospitals.

Season Two
A Stitch in Crime[2.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : You know, in a way I have to congratulate you. Up until now, you really had me going. I mean, here you are, you're a surgeon, a man that's gotta be cool. Even when you're angry you're controlled. You never lose yourself. That's why it struck me funny when you blew up in the operating room and you grabbed me and pushed me. I mean, you know, there was only one thing we didn't search. You know what it was? It was me.</dd></dl>
Season Two
A Stitch in Crime[2.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : It certainly looks like it's one on me, doesn't it? You know, I really believed it all fit together. All the pieces, everything. The killing of the nurse, everything. Well, it goes to show you, Doc, maybe I've been at this job too long. Okay. You win. You're finally rid of me.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Barry Mayfield </b> : You'll be alright, Lieutenant. I'm sure you'll find others to harass.</dd></dl>
Season Two
A Stitch in Crime[2.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : Because that would explain why Miss Martin was so bothered after the operation and it would explain why she wanted to see the chemist at the company that made the suture. That's murder. That certainly is. No question about it.</dd><dd> <i>  [Dr. Mayfield starts laughing] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : What's so funny?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Barry Mayfield </b> : Excuse me, Lieutenant. I had to play it as though you were serious. You don't really believe all those foolish things you say, do you?</dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : <i>  [angrily slams carafe down on desk] </i> I believe you killed Sharon Martin and I believe you're trying to kill Dr. Hidemann.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Barry Mayfield </b> : Lt. Columbo, you're remarkable. You have intelligence. You have perception. You have great tenacity. You've got everything except proof.</dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : I want you to take good care of Dr. Hidemann because if he dies we're going to have to have an autopsy, aren't we? I mean, we're going to have to know whether a heart attack killed him or rather it was just a dissolving suture.</dd></dl>

Columbo </b> : That's what I was trying to get around to, sir, yes. And if somebody else packed it who didn't know that he wore dentures then--</dd><dd> <b>  Mazoor Berozski </b> : Then his accident was not an accident!</dd><dd> <b>  Lt.

Double Shock[2.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : Mrs. Peck? Mrs. Peck, I made a very poor introduction of myself to you. I know that. I'm a stranger in your house that you love and I'm here to do something that's not very pleasant so I don't expect you to like me. But I have feelings too, Mrs. Peck. Now I'm sorry about being untidy. That's something that I can't control. That's a fault of mine that I, I, I don't know, I just can't correct that. I've tried many years. I'm just very untidy, that's my nature. But I've never been un-, I've never been rude to you, Mrs. Peck. And, and if you keep on treating me like an enemy just because I'm here trying to find who killed the man you worked for for 33 years, well, then, well then I think you're a very unfair person. <i>  [leaves] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mrs. Peck </b> : Lt.

Just trying to catch a man who murdered two Suarian nationals along with robbing the legation of $600,000.</dd><dd> <b>  Kermit Morgan </b> : Yes, I'm sure but you're working in delicate and apparently unfamiliar waters, Lieutenant. You can't push around diplomatic personnel the way you would common criminals in the street.

I don't think I would enjoy watching a man kill an animal, even as big and mean as he is.</dd><dd> <b>  Luis Montoya </b> : Perhaps you would prefer the spectacle of two men in a prize ring beating each other senseless. Or murdering an innocent deer with a rifle. Or catching a fish with another one which is still alive. Our culture is different from yours, Lieutenant. No better or worse, perhaps, but different.</dd></dl>

Columbo </b> : Did you injure your leg in the bull ring?</dd><dd> <b>  Luis Montoya </b> : <i>  [nodding] </i> On the Plaza Del Toros, Mexico. It was the wound that ended my career. And, ironically, it wasn't even the bull I was supposed to fight. You see, I was appearing mano a mano with a young matador who froze, and the bull gored him. I jumped to his rescue, and I too, was gored, badly, here. They tried to take me to the infirmiry along with the young matador, but I refused to go. Despite the blood flowing from my would, I stayed in the bull and I did one of the best fights of my career. I killed the bull with one thrust. The people loved it! They stood up and gave me an electrifying ovation. Two ears and a tail! That was my last fight.</dd><dd> <b>  Lt. Columbo </b> : Well, that must have taken a lot of courage, sir.</dd><dd> <b>  Luis Montoya </b> : <i>  [smiling] </i> Well, it would be a difficult thing for me to do now with this leg.</dd></dl>

You see how the very mention of that name renders you completely helpless. You keep forgetting that I know who you are, and where you came from.</dd><dd> <b>  Santini </b> : I was 21. I was merely a boy.</dd><dd> <b>  Jesse Jerome </b> : No one in the S.S. was "merely a boy", Mueller. No one in the camps was just a boy. Unless he was being taken into the oven. Don't misunderstand me. If you push me, I will tell. The newspapers, the immigration service, The Israelis-- yes, the Israelis! Oh, how they's love to get their hands on you.</dd><dd> <b>  Santini </b> : I think not.

But that's exactly what's been bothering me right from the beginning-- time. Ever since I saw that beautiful watch of yours. Time. Why would you check with the guard when you were leaving the island, the time? He's got a drugstore watch.

Um, how did you know, sir?</dd><dd> <b>  Ward Fowler </b> : Why else would you be here?</dd><dd> <b>  Lt.
