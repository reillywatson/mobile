Well, I'll tell you my secret, western Ohio. Sue Sylvester's not afraid to shake things up. You know, I'm tired of hearing people complain, "I'm riddled with this disease!" or "I was in that tsunami!" To them, I say "Shake it up a bit! Get out of your box! Even if that box happens to be where you're living." I'll often yell at homeless people. "Hey, how's that homelessness working out for ya? Give <i>  not </i> being homeless a try, huh?" You know something, Ohio? It's not easy breaking out of your comfort zone. People will tear you down, tell you you shouldn't have bothered in the first place, but let me tell you something. There's not much of a difference between a stadium full of cheering fans and an angry crowd screaming abuse at you. They're both just making a lot of noise. How you take it is up to you. Convince yourself they're cheering for you. You do that, and someday, they will!</dd></dl>
