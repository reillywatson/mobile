Season One
Hell-A Woman
<dl><dd> <b>  Hank Moody </b> : HelL-A Magazine blog number 1. Hank hates you all. A few things I've learned on my travels through this crazy little thing called life. One, a morning of awkwardness is far better than a night of loneliness. Two, I probably won't go down in history, but I will go down on your sister. And 3, while I'm down there it might be nice to see a hint of pubis. I'm not talking about a huge 70's Playboy bush or anything. Just something that reminds me that I'm performing cunnilingus on an adult. But I guess the larger question is why is the city of angels so hell bent on destroying its female population.</dd></dl>

Season One
Hell-A Woman
<dl><dd> <b>  Hank Moody: </b> Well, your breasts are obviously real... and... eh... you have an abundance of pubic hair, which is really nice and... eh... there's no evidence of vaginal rejuvenation. I'd say, aside from the fact that you worship a space alien, you just might be the most beautiful woman I've seen in a long, long time</dd></dl>

That's... that would be like, uh, the immaculate conception. And you, you're the one who... y, you... and then you left.</dd><dd> <b>  Mia Lewis: </b> I'm late for school.</dd></dl>

Season One
LOL
<dl><dd> <b>  Radio show host: </b> What's your latest obsession?</dd><dd> <b>  Hank Moody: </b> Just the fact that people seem to be getting dumber and dumber. You know, I mean we have all this amazing technology and yet computers have turned into basically four figure wank machines. The internet was supposed to set us free, democratize us, but all it's really given us is Howard Dean's aborted candidacy and 24 hour a day access to kiddie porn. People... they don't write anymore, they blog. Instead of talking, they text, no punctuation, no grammar: LOL this and LMFAO that. You know, it just seems to me it's just a bunch of stupid people pseudo-communicating with a bunch of other stupid people at a proto-language that resembles more what cavemen used to speak than the King's English.</dd><dd> <b>  Radio show host: </b> Yet you're part of the problem, I mean you're out there blogging with the best of them.</dd><dd> <b>  Hank Moody: </b> Hence my self-loathing.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Marcy Runkle: </b> You can have the ass if you want.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlie Runkle: </b> You can keep it.</dd></dl>
Season One
Absinthe Makes the Heart Grow Fonder
<dl><dd> <b>  Mia Gross: </b> : Rome is burning, he said, as he poured himself another drink. Yet, here I am knee deep in a river of pussy. Here it comes, she thought. Another self indulgent, whiskey soaked, diatribe about how fucking great everything was in the past. And how all us poor souls born too late to see the Stones at - wherever, or snort the good coke like that they had at Studio 54 - well, we all just missed out on practically everything worth living for. And the worst part was, she agreed with him. Here we are, she thought, at the edge of the world - the very edge of western civilization and all of us are so desperate to feel something... anything... that we keep falling into each other and fucking our way toward the end of days.</dd></dl>
