C'mon, You've been sleeping over since you were seven. It's Saturday night.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Things change, Dawson. Evolve.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : What are you talking about?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Sleeping in the same bed was fine when we were kids, but we're fifteen now.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : We start high school Monday?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : And I have breasts!</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : And you have genitalia!</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I've always had genitalia.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : But there's more of it.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : How do you know?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Long fingers.

Season 1
Pilot (aka Emotions in Motion)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : See, I believe that all the mysteries of the universe, all the answers to life's questions, can be found in a Spielberg film. See, it's a theory I've been working on. You see, whenever I have a problem, all I have to do is look to the right Spielberg movie and the answer's revealed.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Have you ever heard of a twelve-step program?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Wit! We like that around here.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Hey Joey, I love your lipstick. What shade is that?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Wicked Red, uh, Jen, I love your hair color, what number is that?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : You'll have to excuse Joey, she was born in a barn.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : That's okay, uh Joey I just do highlights.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : So, uh Jen are you a virgin?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : That's mature!</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well 'cause Dawson's a virgin and two virgins really make for a clumsy first encounter don't you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : You're going to die</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I just thought I'd help, you know, cut to the chase.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : No it's okay Dawson. Yes I am a virgin. How about you Joey?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Please, years ago. Trucker named Bubba.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Pilot (aka Emotions in Motion)
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : It's a crock. The truth is you're a well put together, knockout of a woman who's feeling a little insecure about hitting forty. So when a young, virile boy, such as myself flirts with you, you enjoy it. You entice it. You fantasize about what it would be like to be with that young boy on the verge of manhood. 'Cause it helps you stay feeling attractive. Makes the aging process a little more bearable. Well, let me tell you something. You blew it, lady. Because I'm the best sex you'll never have.</dd><dd> <b>  Ms. Jacobs </b> : You're wrong about one thing, Pacey. You're not a boy.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Dance (aka Dirty Dancing)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [to Dawson, about Jen] </i> I'm not suggesting leather straps and Crisco, just a kiss.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Dance (aka Dirty Dancing)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Do me a favor? If I get like this again, and I'm sure I will before this adolescent growth process is over... Next time just chain me to my bed and wait for my moment of clarity to come.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Can I use leather straps?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Not until you explain the Crisco!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Dance (aka Dirty Dancing)
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : See the kiss is just the end result. It's not what's important. It's all about desire and wanting.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Dance (aka Dirty Dancing)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Joey, you're going to have kiss him.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I can not and will not kiss that cretin.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : It's a movie. You're playing a character, it's not Pacey your kissing.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : So he's a sea serpent from the deep, cite the difference.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Dance (aka Dirty Dancing)
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : <i>  [to Joey] </i> You have nice breasts. I mean, don't get the wrong idea, I'm completely hetero. I'm just commenting girl to girl. You have a really nice body.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Kiss (aka A Prelude to a Kiss)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You mean, you haven't even kissed that girl?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : It's not about the kiss Joey. It's about the journey, creating a sustaining magic.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Does Jen fall for this warped movie logic?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : It's not warped. It's romance.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : It's old, Dawson. Just kiss her, will you? Take the elevator to the next floor and get off, it's time.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : It's not that simple Joey. It's about creating the perfect moment. And it has to be planned with the right music and dialogue.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You can't storyboard a kiss.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Sure, you can.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : It's not reality, Dawson. These movies that you're watching are false images that don't exist outside the city limits of Hollywood.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Not true. They're images grounded in the reality of imagination.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Did you just pull that one out of your butt, or what?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Everybody thinks that movies are fantasy, but they don't have to be. From here to eternity. You can have that. You just have to create it. That moment on the beach could be yours. You could be Deborah Kerr.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Mm, sand in my crotch, heaven.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : You know, it's attitudes like yours that prevent storyboard romances from happening. You're way too cynical.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Kiss (aka A Prelude to a Kiss)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [to Pacey] </i> And what do you want?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Actually something a little sexy would be good, I gotta a maybe sorta date this evening.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Hmm, who's the lucky farm animal tonight?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Ahh, What's that, what's that stuff that makes a woman horny?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Your polar opposite?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : You mean oysters.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Right oysters, A dozen oysters, Joey, pack 'em up.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Kiss (aka A Prelude to a Kiss)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well, I'm a Pisces, I'm into body piercings, and men with tattoos.</dd><dd> <b>  Anderson </b> : Are you here with your parents? Are you guys on a boat?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Actually, we brought the chauffeur. Mother hates to sail. She doesn't like the sun. She burns easy.</dd><dd> <b>  Anderson </b> : What about you?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I wear lotion.</dd><dd> <b>  Anderson </b> : No, I mean, do you like to sail?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Why do you ask?</dd><dd> <b>  Anderson </b> : I'm taking a survey. Because I want you to come sailing with me, tomorrow.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I can't.</dd><dd> <b>  Anderson </b> : Come on.

This woman here thinks you're very attractive!</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [Trying to shut him up] </i> You butt plug!</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Forget it, Joey. Guys off yachts don't go for waitresses. Huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I'm going to kill you. One night in your sleep, a slit throat maybe or a screwdriver to your temple. Be ready.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Kiss (aka A Prelude to a Kiss)
<dl><dd> <b>  Tamara </b> : Go home, Pacey. You need to find a girl your own age. Not some insane middle-aged woman.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Please, Tamara.</dd><dd> <b>  Tamara </b> : Please no buts. This can't go one second further, it's beyond wrong. You have to understand that.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : You keep saying how it's wrong. And maybe it is. But just to set the record straight, I'm a firm believer that sometimes it's right to do the wrong thing.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Discovery (aka Carnal Knowledge)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : <i>  [about Jen] </i> Oh god, she's perfect.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Perfect? Dawson, you disappoint me.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Those eyes, that hair..</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well, I grant you that the girl has certain physical attributes but nothing so original or mysterious to warrant perfection</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Okay, easy.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I mean, a face like that leaves nothing to the imagination. The well-maintained good looks of an upper-middle class New Yorker. There's no mystery there. I can see her entire future in that pose.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Really?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yeah. In three years her above average SAT scores will grant her admission into a small liberal arts college somewhere in New England where she'll major in...art history before returning to Manhattan to marry a bond trader she meets some Saturday afternoon at America's cup watching party. Within a year they move to suburban Connecticut, refurbish an old farm house, and raise three neurotically perfect children.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : You've put quite a bit of thought into this.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Not really. It's just so obvious.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well, to be honest, I think I prefer to let Jen surprise me, okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Suit yourself. I'm just trying to save you some time.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Discovery (aka Carnal Knowledge)
<dl><dd> <b>  Grams </b> : Oh, Jennifer, you exasperate me. Everything I say isn't meant as criticism.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : No, I know. Some of it's meant as judgment.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Discovery (aka Carnal Knowledge)
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Why are you so surprised every time I jump at the chance to spend time with you?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I don't know. Natural skepticism perhaps?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Well, get over it. Not everything in life has to be so complicated.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Discovery (aka Carnal Knowledge)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Sorry, kitchen's closed.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Well, if you can stand the shock, I actually came to see you. I need some advice.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : And in what field do you consider me an expert in?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Dawson Leery.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You know, I'm sort of busy here with these receipts and locking up maybe we could do this another time.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I told him I wasn't a virgin.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I think I have a minute.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : It's just that he seemed so disappointed in me, which of course made me angry and now I don't know where we are.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well, let me tell you about Dawson. Granted he's articulate for his age but he's not exactly mature. He's the classic only child. He pouts when things don't go his way and he only sees things in black and white. Anything else confuses him.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : And when it comes to women...there are popes who have had more experience. I mean the guy was a shrimp until last summer. To say his sex life is limited is the understatement of the decade. It's barren. A desert. I don't envy what you have to deal with, believe me.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : You're not trying to scare me off, are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : No. I'm just trying to say that every guy that grows up to be one of the good ones...he was probably a dweeb with girls when he was 15, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : So what would you do?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Same as you. I'd get hurt, mad, confused, ask people for advice, maybe the wrong people, and then I'd wait.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : For what?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : For him to grow up, come around, everything.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : And how long does that take?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Don't go by me. I'd probably be stupid enough to wait forever.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Mind a little company?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Discovery (aka Carnal Knowledge)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Hanging out with all your friends?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yep. That's why you weren't invited.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Phasers on stun, I come in peace. You're going to screw it up, you know?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Jen. She came and talked to me. I told her sit tight, he'll be back...</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Thanks. Appreciate it, Joey.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I explained to her that it's just displaced anger and you're just mad at your mom and dad.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I'm mad at the world, Joey. I'm a teenager.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Hurricane (aka Blown Away)
<dl><dd> <b>  Gail </b> : <i>  [on TV] </i> Well, Bob, it looks like tomorrow would be a good day just to stay in bed.</dd><dd> <b>  Bob </b> : You've got that right, Gail.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : God, could they be any more obvious? So, Gail, what are your current views on the situation in Bosnia? Will you be jumping my bones after the broadcast?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Hurricane (aka Blown Away)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Look, maybe you better go, Joey. My verbal vomit's out of control today.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I know what you're going through Dawson. You're struggling to find answers. You want to know why she's cheating but it's all perception Dawson. Let me just offer the one ounce of wisdom I can bring to this table. You know instead of asking why your mother's doing all these horrible things, may I suggest that you get down on your knees and thank God that you have a mother!</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Joey...</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Sorry, Dawson, I forgot for a second. This isn't about me.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Hurricane (aka Blown Away)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You know, it's just an ego thing. I mean, "How could there possibly have been anyone before me, you know, how can I measure up?"</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Is he really that trite?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I'm sure there's a measuring tape sitting in his bathroom right now.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : What do you think it's marked up at?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : What do you mean?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Oh come on, do you think Dawson's got a pistol or a rifle?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : How would I know?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Oh, come on.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Well I guess I'm no longer the virgin queen of Dawson Leery's handheld fantasies.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yeah I think Dawson's having a life-defining turning point in his life right now.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Aren't we all?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You know, taking into consideration his height, weight, feet and hand size, I'd say he's slightly above average.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Oh, so you have thought about it.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Hurricane (aka Blown Away)
<dl><dd> <b>  Grams </b> : Mr. Ryan used to say, "If you want the rainbow, you've got to put up with a lot of rain."</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : So you know, too?</dd><dd> <b>  Grams </b> : I used to be a big fan of motion pictures. Frank Capra , <i>  It's a Wonderful Life </i> , <i>  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington </i> , <i>  Pocketful of Miracles </i> . Simple desires fulfilled, aspirations realized.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Fears of abandonment turned into fantasy spectacles of security and joy. Frank Capra and Steven Spielberg were often compared for their thematic content.</dd><dd> <b>  Grams </b> : What I like most about those movies is the fact that no matter how far off the pedestal the character fell they always got a second chance. Forgiveness is one of the greatest gifts the Lord has given us with it comes understanding.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Same way rain brings a rainbow.</dd><dd> <b>  Grams </b> : From what I've seen of you so far, you better buy yourself a good umbrella.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Hurricane (aka Blown Away)
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I'm leaving, Dawson, um, but before I go there's--</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : But Jen I'm--</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : No, no, hear me out, Dawson, please. Okay? Because this seems to be the day of truths, and I'm taking my turn. I lost my virginity when I was 12 to some older guy who got me drunk, I don't really remember his name but after the first pregnancy scare I went on the pill, and I used condoms most of the time, some of the times, I don't know, it's kind of blurry. I was really drinking a lot and having blackouts and stuff, um. I was sexualized way too young, and I don't wish that on anybody. I mean, sex at such a young age, more often than not, is a bad idea. I finally got caught having sex in my parents' bed. Daddy's little girl fornicating right before his very eyes. He still can't look me in the face but then again he shipped me 200 miles away so he wouldn't have to, but Dawson I'm not that girl anymore. I never really was, and I'm not that white-as-snow image you've got either, I'm somewhere in between and I'm just, I'm just trying to figure it out.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Jen. It's not you. It's my own stupid hangups. My parents have this raging sex life and I just, I secretly used it as their measure of happiness.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Well, sex doesn't equal happiness.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah, I know. I know that now.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I'm sorry about lying to you, but I can't apologize for my past. I mean, I've learned from it, I'm a better person, it's gotten me here. And this is my chance to start over. It's my chance and it would be really nice if you'd be a part of that.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : On one condition?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : That you'll have me. Jen because my behavior has been unredeemable and I don't deserve someone as impassionate and open and honest and beautiful as you are. <i>  [They hug] </i> Take 2?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Mm-hm.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Baby (aka Look Who's Talking)
<dl><dd> <b>  Bodie </b> : Good morning sweetheart. And how are we feeling this morning?</dd><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : Well, if you're nauseous and swollen and irritable also, I'd say we're feeling exactly the same way.</dd><dd> <b>  Bodie </b> : Look at the bright side. Your due date's the 22nd. In less than a week this will all be over.</dd><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : A week?! This can not last another week. It's inhumane. I don't sleep anymore, my legs are fat, my back is killing me, I feel like retching 23 hours a day... Did you know the average gestation period for the fruit bat is 2 months... 2 months, that's fair, that's reasonable. Why can't I give birth to a fruit bat?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Because we're about 80% sure you're human.</dd><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : Do you still live here?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Unfortunately.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Baby (aka Look Who's Talking)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Hey, jailbait.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Feel free to keep on walking. I won't think you're rude.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Look, despite first impressions, I'm not here to bust on you. I don't know if the rumors are true or exaggerated. Or if this is one of your bizarre attempts to appear more attractive to the senior girls. But I just wanted to say I know what you must be going through, and...</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : <i>  [laughs] </i> No. I really doubt you know what I'm going through.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well let me see. People stare at you when you walk down the hall, we've seen that. They whisper behind your back. You suddenly overhear your name in a conversation of strangers. And pretty soon a justifiable paranoia sets in and whether they are or not, you are convinced that everyone is talking about you. Imagine if you had done something even worse.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Like what?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Like sharing a house with your pregnant unwed sister and her black boyfriend, while your father serves time on a drug conviction. Imagine that, Pacey. We actually have something in common... Providing gossip for the small-minded townsfolk. And unfortunately for you, you're tonight's top story.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Great. So, what do I do now?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Same thing I did... You pray like hell for a better story to come along.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Baby (aka Look Who's Talking)
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Grams' way of dealing with my point of view is pretending that it doesn't exist. Which, of course, infuriates me. It causes me to speak emotionally rather than rationally, and I become rude and defensive, and I...I give her even more of a reason to dismiss my viewpoints. Its like we're locked in this awful vicious cycle.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well, I don't know. You gotta do something. You just can't ignore her for three years until you go away to college.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I can't? Oh, there goes plan A.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Baby (aka Look Who's Talking)
<dl><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : <i>  [grabs the phone] </i> Listen, you sorry ass civil servant. This is the mother-to-be talking. Maybe I'm not in the tax bracket that guarantees a prompt response to medical distress, but I have a shoe full of amniotic fluid, my pelvis is beating like a rumba band, and I'm in real danger of having my first-born child delivered by two high school students. So, why don't you stop making excuses, get off your oversized backside and get us an ambulance before my fetus enters college?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Terrific. I'm sure they will be right on their way.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Baby (aka Look Who's Talking)
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Look I don't mean any disrespect here. But, if you'll just give me a second, I'll have you all home for dinner. OK? Look, I know the origin of these rumors has been traced to me. And, ah I guess that would make sense. 'Cause look at me, here I am a C+ student, who sits in the back of Ms. Jacobs English class everyday, daydreaming about the same thing. About, what it would be like to be... a little bit better looking, a little more sophisticated and about 15 years older. 'Cause, then and only then, could Ms. Jacobs possibly look at me as anything other than just another one of her students. And, only then, could this rumor stand any chance of being true. Ah, I mean, don't get me wrong, I am flattered with the seriousness that you took these allegations, but you know personally I'd just chalked them up to adolescent fantasy. I kind of expected you guys to do the same.</dd><dd> <b>  Superintendent Stevens </b> : Correct me if I'm wrong Mr. Witter, but for the record, are you saying you deny the aforementioned allegations?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Yeah, for the record, sir. And for anywhere else you want to put it. Ms. Jacobs is my English teacher and to my great disappointment absolutely nothing else.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Detention (aka The Breakfast Club)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You can't stand the idea that if a girl is choosing between two guys, she may not choose the romantic doofus who woos her with flowers and cheesy poems, you know? She just might choose the guy with the faster car or the bigger bicep or... the bigger joystick.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Bigger joystick?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : First of all, girls are attracted to romance more than anything.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Keep hope alive there.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Detention (aka The Breakfast Club)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : This is so <i>  Breakfast Club </i> .</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Breakfast Club?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah that John Hughes movie where the five kids are stuck in detention all day.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yeah at first they hate each other and then they become really, really good friends.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Oh yeah that movie stunk. Whatever happened to those actors?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Anthony Michael Hall developed some weird thyroid condition, Molly Ringwald lost her gauky ingenue appeal, and the rest are languishing somewhere in TV obscurity.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : No way! Emilio Estevez ! He was in those Duck movies , remember? God, those were classics, so funny....What?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Detention (aka The Breakfast Club)
<dl><dd> <b>  Abby </b> : I'm so bored.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, where's your ecstasy Abby? You and I can just go on down to the boy's locker room and you know...</dd><dd> <b>  Abby </b> : I don't have any left and if I did I wouldn't waste it on Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : What? You're not going to let Rudolph join in any of your perverted reindeer games?</dd><dd> <b>  Abby </b> : Hey now there's an idea, games. We could all play a game.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Really? What do you want to play? Pin the tail on the ho-bag?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Detention (aka The Breakfast Club)
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : So do you think you can stop throwing basketballs at my face now, Dawson? I think it's glaringly obvious that I'm not going to steal your girlfriend. I mean, at least you have a girlfriend. I've got nothing left.</dd><dd> <b>  Abby </b> : You have your hand.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Detention (aka The Breakfast Club)
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Hey Dawson. I like you.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah but it's not enough that you like me. I want you to want me.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : You're like a God to me Dawson, and I don't even believe in God. I mean, this school hasn't exactly welcomed me with open arms. It seems like everybody here hates me and I don't know why. If it's because I'm from New York, or because I'm different. It seems like my life here is just one big detention that I can't escape, but then, I think about you. And about how I've met a guy who's so romantic, and so caring, and who I like, and who I want so much. Dawson it's because of you that I get through the bad days. And if you think I want you to be some big, varsity sex stud then you're crazy.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I understand that you want to take things slow, I do. And I don't want to rush you. I don't want to be that guy. But I'm human, I have hormones. And to say that I've never thought about having sex with you, I'd be lying. The thought crosses my mind. About a thousand times a day.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Well just a thousand? That's nothing.</dd></dl>

Decisions (aka Breaking Away)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Cliffhanger? Come on, Dawson. You of all people should know that a cliffhanger is merely a manipulative TV standard designed to improve ratings.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : No, a cliffhanger's purpose is to keep people interested. Keep them guessing what's going to happen in future episodes.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : But just like in our own lives, they are so predictable. I mean, the producers put the characters in some contrived situation hoping that the audience will think something is going to change, but, you know what? It never does. Back to the same way it was before your so-called cliffhanger. It's boring Dawson.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well, what if this time it's different? What if this time in the cliffhanger something changes? You wouldn't want to miss that, would ya?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : It still sounds like one big tease to me Dawson.</dd></dl>

I mean, she's smart, she's beautiful, she's funny, she's a big ol' scaredy cat. If you creep up from behind her she'll jump out of her skin. It's pretty amusing. She's honest. She always calls them just like she sees them. You can always count on getting the truth from Joey even if the truth hurts. She's stubborn. We fight a lot. She can be so frustrating sometimes. But she's a really, really, good friend. I know her to a fault. She believes in me. And I'm a dreamer so it's so good to have somebody like that in my life. If she goes away, I don't know what I'm going to do. I mean, she's my best friend, you know? She's more than that. She's everything.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Decisions (aka Breaking Away)
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Hi. I don't really know what I'm doing here. That's not true. Um, look, I came here tonight to say, I came here to tell you that you messed up. You really messed up. And not because you broke the law or you got caught or that you left me without a father. You messed up because you don't know me. I'm your daughter and you don't know me at all. So I guess I just came to say that I'm alright. I turned out pretty good. And I'm going to be okay, no help from you. And um I just have one question. Do you love me?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Potter </b> : More than you'd ever know. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Do you think about me?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Potter </b> : Sweetheart, all day long, everyday, every hour, every minute.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Do you really love me, though? Because I'm 15 years old and I go through every day of my life thinking that nobody loves me.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Potter </b> : Well nothing could be further from the truth. And I'm not the only one. Dawson Leery. He loves you Joey. He's never told you?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Never.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Potter </b> : Well, he does. I know it.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : How?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Potter </b> : Because he looks at you the same way your mother used to look at me. And you love him...Have you told him? You have to tell him Joey. Don't make my mistake. Don't wait til someone you love is eaten with cancer and wasting away while you hold back...</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I love you Dad.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Potter </b> : I love you.</dd></dl>

You know, I am so tired of the way we relate to one another. We spend all of our time analyzing our sad little adolescent lives.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I know we know too many big words. But it's a good thing to analyze.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : But it doesn't get us anywhere. It doesn't move us forward. We're in the same place we were 3 months ago. It's time to grow up Dawson.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I know, Joey. We can. We are growing up.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : No we're not. Everyday is the same. We watch a movie, preferably a Spielberg film, find the appropriate life correlation and then we pat ourselves on the back for being so clever. You know, as much as our perception is right on, our honesty is severely lacking Dawson.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : There is something lacking.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : And the reason I came here tonight is because we need to move on. Look, we're not kids anymore. And I'm not gonna do this anymore. And I just thought you should know, so...</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : So, are you going to France?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Ah, the inevitable cliffhanger. Am I going to France?</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Kiss
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : You know I can't believe this. After years of gratuitous self-examination, you finally did it, you acted. I mean, I thought you and Joey were going to draw out this 'will they-won't they' drama for at least another couple of years. Sam and Diane didn't get together for at least 4 seasons and Mulder and Scully...they haven't even kissed! If you and Joey can get across this romantic checkmate thing you've been in for GOD knows how many years...anything is possible!</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Kiss
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Me not going to France...you and me talking dirty in the halls...I mean, do you think we're making some massive, monumental mistake? I mean, things have always been so complicated between...</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I think we'll be fine. I mean granted we'll be entering some uncharted boy/girl territory but I honestly think regardless of how complicated things are on a day to day basis, we'll be fine. We'll concentrate on the simple stuff.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Like what?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Like a date.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : A date?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Mm-hm.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You and me on a date?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yep.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I don't know Dawson. I was gonna watch TV. I hear Luke Perry is returning to 90210.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Kiss
<dl><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : Oh, the first date. This will be interesting. Hey, what's wrong?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I don't know it just seems weird. I mean, Dawson and I on a date? Doesn't that seem weird to you?</dd><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : Well was it weird when you kissed?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : No, that felt pretty right. But the thing is, it hasn't happened since then and it was yesterday.</dd><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : Well, that's not unusual, because the way I see it, the second kiss, it's always tougher than the first one.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : We actually kissed more than once that night.</dd><dd> <b>  Bessie </b> : Yeah, but it only counts as one and that first kiss...it's the passionate one. It's the one filled by desire and attraction, and all of that, but the second kiss is rational. You got time to worry, and over analyze and most women....they prefer that first kiss, but I'm partial to the second one because it's about something more. You'll get that second kiss Joey and when you do it'll be great. It'll be real. It'll be meaningful.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Kiss
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I'm really glad we've already bypassed the end of the evening "Will she kiss me?" drama. So, um, it should pretty much me smooth sailing from here on out.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yeah, but now you have to endure the agony of "Well, I've already kissed her so should we just check into a motel and go at it like porn stars?" anxiety.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I, um, I think I can handle that.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Good because I know a good motel.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Kiss
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Do you want to know why I didn't go to France? 'Cause I wanted to so badly. I mean, in France I could have started over, you know. I wouldn't be Joey the waitress, or Joey the daughter of a convict, or Joey half of the "will they/won't they" couple of the century. I didn't go to France because it just seemed like the easy way out, you know? The easiest escape from my life, which in spite of a few highlights is pretty pathetic. But I didn't want to take that easy way out, Dawson. It just seemed like sticking around here would only make me stronger. Then there was you too. Dawson Leery, who finally got a clue. But I have to tell you Dawson, as complicated our friendship was, it doesn't even compare to how complicated whatever you and I have here is bound to be.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Really? What you and I have may never be simple...but that doesn't mean that we're not going to be scorching. Besides, who's to say that you can't have some of France right here in Capeside, hum? Here we are along the river Seine, a tour of the il de la city, the favorite spot of lovers and friends. And from here we also have a view of the magnificent structure that we simplists here in Capeside like to call....ze swingset. Granted, It's no Eiffel Tower, but it's all we got. But don't forget about the other franc-o-fellow opportunities in town. French fries.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : French toast.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : French doors.</dd><dd> <i>  [They kiss] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : French kiss. The second kiss, the rational one. The one that requires thought.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : So what? I mean at least she didn't tell you that the sight of you gives her dry heaves or that you're a self-centered, self-absorbed, selfish...</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah, but she obviously has opinions about me that she hasn't been honest about. She said I was a..a talentless dreamer with no cinematic future.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Okay, no offense, Dawson, but I don't think anybody cares.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I care. And Pacey I could honestly use some advice here.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Oh, you want some advice? How about this? Your life is not that interesting.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : You know I am so sick and tired of hearing about you and Joey's boring little mini dramas I'm going to start tearing out my fingernails for relief.

<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : <i>  [To Mr. Peterson] </i> What is it about you that gets off on tormenting your students? Because let me tell you, they may all live in fear of you, but I don't.

To Be Or Not To Be...
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [His Poem] </i> Today. Today was a day. The world got smaller, darker. I grew more afraid. Not of what I am but of what... I grew more afraid. Not of what I am but of what I could be. I loosen my collar to take a breath. My eyes fade. And I see... Him. The image of perfection. His frame strong. His lips smooth. And I keep thinking. What am I so scared of... I wish I could escape the pain, but these thoughts invade my head. Bound to my memory, they're like shackles of guilt. Oh God, please set me free...</dd></dl>

Think about the way that you treated me and the way that you treated Tim. Because he was the real son, and I was different. And as hard as you've tried to stamp it out and to ignore it, I have tried harder. I've tried harder than you, to be quiet, and to forget it, and to not bother my family with my problem. But I can't try anymore, because it hurts. I'm sorry Dad. Andie, I'm sorry. I don't want to be going through this, but I am.</dd></dl>

Look, it was never about looking for something better, Dawson. It was about looking for someone who wasn't so close to me. Where I could tell where I ended and he began. I mean, our lives have always been so intertwined that in many ways I feel like you partially invented me, Dawson. And that scares me so much. I need to find out if I can be a whole person without you. I need to find out if I can be a whole person....alone.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well, do it quickly, okay?

Season 2
Rest in Peace
<dl><dd> <b>  Andie </b> : Um, there are people who give me comfort in my life. Um, when the going gets rough as it invariably does I can count on them as a shoulder to cry on. And they will pick me up when I fall and hold me in their arms as I cry, and tell me that everything is going to be alright. I am so thankful for these people they are priceless... But there's another group of people, just as important, and just as priceless. They are the people who challenge me, who push me to my breaking points, and who force me to muster courage I never thought I had. Abby Morgan was one of those people. In her own truth-telling way she gave me strength, I'm a stronger woman because of her, stronger than I ever thought that I could be. She gave me that gift. She's was one of a kind. There's no one like her and she will always hold a special spot in my heart.</dd></dl>

Season 2
Reunited
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : You have to Andie, you have to choose, and I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart to please choose me... Open this door, come out here and choose me, please.

Season 2
Reunited
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well I have to admit I am a little surprised that you are okay with this considering that it is our one month anniversary for whatever we are, or were, or are.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Joey, we are boring, trite people okay? We're absolutely incapable of spontaneity. We do things like plan, and organize, and make reservations weeks in advance at top notch restaurants to celebrate one month anniversaries of whatever we are, or were...or are.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : <i>  [to Joey] </i> Because I'm afraid okay? I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you and that I never will be alright? And if I do this that you're just going to realize that you've grown way beyond me and then I'm... I'm just going to lose you again.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Ch...Ch...Ch...Changes
<dl><dd> <b>  Mr.McPhee </b> : If I'd just been around more.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : It wouldn't have made a difference. I'm gay for the same reasons that Tim wasn't. It just happened that way.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr.McPhee </b> : But there are people who change, they go back.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I'm hardly the encyclopedia of the gay experience but, I'd wager to say that their change is skeptical.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr.McPhee </b> : How do you know? Unless you try.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I don't want to try. Why do you want me to try?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr.McPhee </b> : Because I can not understand why anyone would choose that kind of life.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I didn't choose it. The only thing I chose was to be happy. Look, I can't go back for you because slowly but surely I'd be going to sacrifice my happiness for yours because I want you to be proud of me. But not under your terms. It just, it won't work.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Ch...Ch...Ch...Changes
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : <i>  [to Jen] </i> Look, I often wonder how my mom would act if she was aware of what was happening to me, if she was capable of comprehending it. I don't think she'd have a problem with it because my mom loves me for the best reason possible... no reason at all. Because that's the way our parents should love us Jen. Unconditionally. Sadly, most parents don't. But as much as it hurts... it's worse for them. It is worse to be incapable of loving then to not be loved.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Ch...Ch...Ch...Changes

How could I possibly know what it's like to let somebody go, right? How hard it is to let someone go. The pain of knowing that even though the two of you are right for each other, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're right for each other right now. What would I know about that, right?

Homecoming
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Pacey, you probably don't want to hear this right now, and I'm sure you don't want to hear it from me, but you have to talk to her.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : No, not right now. I couldn't even look at her right now.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You have to, Pacey. You have to hear her out.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Why? What's the difference, Joey, huh? No matter what she says the ending's still the same. She slept with somebody else.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You think that just because the two of you were together what she did hurts more? It doesn't. There's no difference, Pacey, I mean... Look, she's sixteen years old and so are you. We talk like we know what's going on, but we don't. We don't have any idea. Look, we're really young and we're gonna screw up a lot! You know, we're going to keep changing our minds and ... and sometimes even our hearts. And through all of that, the only real thing we can offer each other is forgiveness. And I couldn't do that. Or at least I did it too late. Don't let yourself get so angry that you stop loving because one day you wake up from that anger and the person you love will be gone</dd></dl>

None of the Above
<dl><dd> <b>  Andie </b> : Don't worry, Pacey. This isn't going to be one of those horribly awkward, hope-boy-didn't-mean-all those-hurtful-things-he-said-during-the-break-up-moment.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well that's a relief 'cuz I sure don't wanna play the guy-feels-guilty-about-breakup-even-though-it-was-girl-who-had-an-affair-with-the-mental-patient-scene.</dd></dl>

Season 3
None of the Above
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I bet when she offered you that test you didn't fire one ethical comment her way, did you?... It's just your friends who have to sit here and... and suffer through the Dawson Leery morality play, bleached blond ho-bags willing to put out need not audition.</dd></dl>
Season 3
None of the Above
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : No, I wanted to consult the people I thought I trusted to determine what the best thing was to do. I never thought anyone would be so weak or so self motivated to actually swipe it.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Weak and self motivated, huh? Now which one of those two colorful adjectives would i be?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : You are who you are, Pacey.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Yes I am, Dawson. And so are you. <i>  [Pokes him in the chest] </i> You, Dawson Leery are a self-righteous, son of a bitch who cares more about his rose colored defunct 1950's belief system then the people who fail to live up to it, huh?!</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Interesting choice of words coming from a smug, cold-hearted son of a bitch who just dumped his girlfriend after she begged and pleaded for an ounce of sympathy.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : At least I didn't send her father to prison.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : No, you just made her go crazy. <i>  [Pacey punches him in the eye.

<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Hey, brought you a Pepsi.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : No thanks, I'm not thirsty.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : It's for your lip, moron. I'm out of ice.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I can't believe he thought I'd take that-</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : So what, Pacey</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I thought if I'd earned anyone's respect, it was his. I mean, if the guy who knows you better than anybody on earth thinks you're a loser, then maybe...</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Then maybe you are one? Come on, I mean I thought you were a loser for years but you never believed me. <i>  [They smile at each other] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : It's just...you know when does a person start believing the general consensus about themselves?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : When it's right. <i>  [They pause and look at each other] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Do me a favor?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Hmm?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Can you tell your friend Dawson that I'm innocent? I mean, he'll believe you.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : No, my friend? Look he's your friend too. And you know as well as I do that he's somewhere right now sulking over the gravity of his wrongful accusation.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well good, let him stew in his own pride for a while.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Now we're all guilty of that.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Hey, I'd never accuse him of cheating.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yeah, well I'm pretty sure he'd never take the first swing at you.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : He started that whole thing!</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I'm not getting into this.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Okay, so tell me.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : What do you think happened to that test?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I don't know. And to be honest, I don't want to know. I mean there are certain things in life you're just...better off not knowing. And things that you wish you never knew, never asked and...never saw.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Okay, so tell me honestly...does it look that bad?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : On your face, any reconstructive surgery whatsoever, is a definite improvement. <i>  [Pacey gives her a look, she smiles and laughs] </i></dd></dl>

OK, it's Jen. You know this whole thing just started as a bad joke, and excuse to get out of biology but you see what it's turned into? I have pranced around this entire school at pep rallies without even knowing what the hell pep is. I have listened to prate and paddle about car washes, dance-athons and dog-sitting until I think I'm going to puke up my homemade spirit cookie.</dd><dd> <b>  Cheerleader #1 </b> : Jenny!</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : And despite the itch I am getting on my ass from this polyester molest-me skirt, I've done it all with a smile of my face. But you know what ladies? The smile has gone. I'm sorry, but there is no way that I'm going to be sold off like some harem girl to the highest bidder. Everyone has a limit, and I've reached mine.

Where did you get this?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : A friend of my brother's, he works down at the marina. He rescued her after the last hurricane. The guy who owned it didn't want her any more, so I convinced him to sell it to me for like, two hundred bucks. When I finish with this boat it is going to be sheer perfection. Look at that.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Pacey, do you know how much money and time it will take to even get this boat to float?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Yeah. Not a minute more or less than as long as it takes me.

Indian Summer
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Dawson, not all of us are as immune to the law of sex as you are. I mean, not all of us would opt for the warm and fuzzy emotional connections over those of, let's say a more physical nature, you know what I mean? Most of us are just big dumb guys happy to sell our souls for the slimmest chance, of gettin' some.</dd></dl>

Much better than these two and they've been here all week. But you used to date, didn't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Uh...look, not right now, okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : I'm right, aren't I? You dated, it didn't work out. But then you got past all your issues and now you actually trust each other, right? See, you can see that in the dancing. You can see, that the trust is there. Now these two on the other hand... <i>  [Points out Pacey and Joey dancing] </i> Whole different story. I mean, look at them. Look at their..their form, look at the tension in their arms...</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Okay is there some sort of problem here?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : What did I say about rib cages touching?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : No, sorry.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : It's just not going to happen, alright?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Right...see what I mean? See the hostility, the way they're weary with each other, not to mention the constant bickering and name calling. Now these two clearly are in the early stages of some screwball mating ritual.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [Scoffs] </i> Okay, you've got it all wrong, lady.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Really? I do?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Oh, completely.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Actually, you could not be more wrong.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Okay. There's enough sexual tension here to power a KISS reunion tour. I can't remember the last time I saw dancing this bad....true...</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Wait a minute, you think that just because they can't dance that they're...?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Well, it's this theory that I've developed based on years of experience...if people dance that badly, then they're usually hot for each other...the dancing doesn't lie.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Four to Tango
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Okay, so... Do you want to just tell me what's going on?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : It's not what you think, Dawson, not even close.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : How do you know what I think?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, because man it's written all over your face, okay? Yes, me and Joey have been spending a lot of time together recently, because we've been here trying to learn how to ballroom dance and then she's teaching me a little trigonometry. You know what's much more interesting to me is that out of all the possible blond and brunette combinations, of women you and I both know, the first one that popped into your mind is Joey, now why is that, do you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Pacey, you're not going to get out of this by attempting to psychoanalyze me.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I'm just asking a simple question. I mean, Dawson, you and Joey...she's not your girlfriend anymore.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Right, she's not.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey: </b> : Right...so then why are we having this conversation? See where I'm going with this? I mean, you're the same guy who told me a couple weeks ago that the two of you just needed to go your separate ways.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah, we do need to go our separate ways, it just never occurred to me that...</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : That what? That she would actually go her separate way too...or perhaps it didn't occur to you that her separate way would include a stop over at me, is that what it is? God, man, this is the way it always is with you, you talk and talk but you don't listen to yourself. I mean, you say you're over her, but you're not. They're just words. They don't mean anything to you.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : You don't know what you're talking about.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : <i>  [Scoffs and turns and gestures over at Joey, who is dancing with an old man] </i> Look at that girl, Dawson. Just take a good look, she's a freaking goddess, man, how long did you think it was going to be before some guy comes along and is interested in her, I mean really dude, and when that happens, what are you going to do?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I-I'm just going to take it all as it comes.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : You're going to take is at it comes, hombre, well perhaps you should start figuring out right now, because the guy that comes along is not going to be your best friend and he's not going to ask for your permission, the guy that comes along is going to take one look at that woman and just cut right in on ya.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : What are you hiding, Pacey?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Because all this analysis on my love life doesn't change the fact that you haven't answered my original question, why did I find that condom?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Why do I bother? <i>  [Turns around and walks away] </i></dd></dl>

I know, not so smart, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Smart or not smart, it's just...funny, you went to her.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, I wouldn't say that I went to her. I mean, she just kind of happened to be there, we were studying.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Can I ask you something, Pacey? What is it about her?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : She's obviously got something that makes boys and emotional turmoil just flock to her.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Come again?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Come on, Dawson's the same way. Whatever small problem got to him he went straight to Joey.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : So who else would you have me talk to? I can't exactly go to Andie with something like this, so I guess I'm supposed to commune with deputy Doug then?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Dawson. Why couldn't you just go to Dawson?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : <i>  [Chuckles] </i> What?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Unless, of course you now feel uncomfortable talking to him about your sex like considering...</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Considering what?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : That your current girl Friday used to be his.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : <i>  [scoffs] </i> Okay, now correct me if I'm wrong, but Dawson Leery didn't actually know about you and I till, what? Two minutes ago.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I'm not talking about us.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : What, Joey? This has nothing to do with Joey!</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Pacey, I saw the way you overreacted to Dawson, I saw the way that Joey overreacted to us. I know you're having trouble in math these days, but it doesn't take Einstein to get the sum total of these two overreactions.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : You're gonna have to explain this one to me, because I've gotta be missing something here, you're talking about Joey Potter, right, the one who can't walk into the same room with me without gagging, huh? That Joey Potter. There is nothing going on between us!</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : No, Pacey there's nothing between us!</dd></dl>

Okay, well the Midas touch, whatever that is, I've got the opposite.</dd><dd> <b>  Mitch </b> : Don't be so sure. I mean, look at you, you're still at it, you haven't given up. Pace, instead of..dwelling on everything that's gone wrong this weekend..so far..um...think of what you've contributed. I mean you've put a lot of selfless work into this place, right?

Especially when you're smart ass like me.</dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : Is she pretty?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Yeah, she is pretty. She is very very pretty.

You see if I was to actually do something about this, there is the strong possibility that the sun would cease to shine, that the tides would cease to rise. In fact, I'm betting there's a pretty good chance that the very earth would crack open and Capeside would become home to a huge hell mouth, that would spew forth endless hoards of monsters and demons that would choke the denizens of this city, making them fall to their knees and PRAY for a return to the days before...I took action. That's really what we're talking about here.</dd></dl>

That I had...hypothetically speaking, fallen for or was in the process of falling for the worst possible person I could fall for. What would you tell me to do?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I guess I would tell you that...impossible situations are only made better by doing something about them.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : So I should just go and declare myself to her so that she can laugh in my face? That's a great idea.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : How do you know that's how she would react?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well I have it on pretty good authority that my rough charms don't really register on her rarefied romantic pallet.

I mean, this isn't exactly the easiest thing i've ever had to do, Pacey. Telling Dawson that while he wasn't looking I developed this bizarre, gravitational pull towards his best friend and I can't stop thinking about him or wanting to be near him or wanting to kiss him all the time. <i>  [she grabs his face and kisses him.

I'm the one that got you into this situation and frankly the only way I want to save my friendship with Dawson, is to be completely honest with him, so I gotta do this. All I need is one day. Just one day.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [Nods] </i> One day.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Yes, one day.</dd></dl>

And I hate myself, I mean, I wish we could go back to the way it was, I wish I could take it all back, but I can't. Nothing is worth going through all of this. No one person is worth this.

Season 3
True Love
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You're so much of my life, Dawson. I mean, your house is my house and your family is my family and there's not a single significant event I've experienced that you haven't experienced with me and I was so afraid of losing that, but, that wasn't the choice, and if I thought that there was a chance that you would forgive me, I may have chosen differently... and you deserve to know that.</dd></dl>

Season 4
Coming Home
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Just what would we be missing from the land of poorly scripted melodramas, huh? Recycled plot lines, tiresome self-realizations. You throw in the occasional downward spiral of a dear friend, and maybe a baby here and a death there and all you've really got is a recipe for some soul sucking, mind numbing ennui, and I for one could skip it.</dd></dl>

Coming Home
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Pacey... I wanted to see Dawson tonight, not because for four months of my life he was my boyfriend, but because for the better part of my life he was my friend. And as my friend, I hurt him deeply, and living with that fact has caused me no small amount of guilt over the past three months. So, yes, I have been preoccupied, and it has made my mind wander, but... my heart? That's a fixed point. Three months riding the open waters couldn't shake it; I'll be damned if I let your insecurities shake it. My heart never left this boat. It's never left you. As far as I can see it's not going to anytime soon.</dd></dl>

Season 4
Failing Down
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : <i>  [to Jen] </i> Take it from someone who spent the better part of last spring angry at the world, it's not worth it. I mean, it might numb the pain a little bit, but it's basically just a distraction. My point is: if you do it right, Jen, loving somebody is gonna hurt and the sooner you let yourself feel that, the sooner you'll be able to love again.</dd></dl>

The Tao of Dawson
<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : <i>  [in his letter to Gretchen] </i> Dear Gretchen, I really enjoyed talking to you in your room today. Try not to be nervous about starting high school. I know you're going to find people that understand you. There's something that I didn't get a chance to tell you. There's someone truly special in my life that I can't stop thinking about. She's unlike anyone I've ever met. Smart and funny and beautiful and just knowing that she's in my life has given me this constant fluttering that keeps me awake at night. When I think about who I can talk to about this, who will understand, the only person that comes to mind is you. And that's a problem because you are the one that I feel this way about. I think about you constantly, every little thing you do. The Elvis Costello sticker you put on your spiral notebook, the way your bangs have grown out every day now for 6 months until Monday when you were finally able to put it all in a ponytail. Today when you invited me to stay and talk to you after Pacey left, it occurred to me that you must think of me too. If I tried to tell anyone else, they would say that you and I are impossible, that our lives are too different, that we could never be right for each other. But we understand each other and we care about each other and years from now I believe that we still will. Your friend forever, love, Dawson.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I'm offering a brother's opinion, okay, and, as your brother, I can firmly tell you... That is not a leaving-the-house kind of outfit.

They design them specifically for sisters on dates.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Gretchen </b> : Yeah, me as Pacey's sister and her ever trusty barkeep, maybe. Me as Mrs. Robinson, maybe not.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Come on, 3 years does not make you Mrs. Robinson.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Do you want to know what I'm scared of? 'Cause I'm not scared of whether or not we sleep together, if-- if and when you and I decide to do that, it will be right.

<dl><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I mean...do I pray for him to make it, to sit up in his bed and tell us that we've all been here long enough and it's time to go home?

At first it's intoxicating, irresistible, and then slowly it becomes comfortable and safe. You have this cellular connection to it, as if you've known each other forever, like your oldest happiness. Sometimes you're on the outs and sometimes you're making up, and every now and then you catch yourself in this transcendent moment where you think to yourself "Oh my god, I'm madly in love with you and I always will be," and I think that's when it surprises me.</dd></dl>

How's this for pathetic... I'm technically still a junior. I'm not even supposed to be here.</dd><dd> <b>  Gretchen </b> : A brother who's too young and a sister who's too old.

Season 4
The Graduate
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Principal Peskin, our families, my fellow graduates, I stand here before you aware of the similarities that we share. I know that you're feeling, outside of my incredible stage fright, the same things that I'm feeling-- pride and accomplishment, closure and regret, and a hopeful outlook on the future. But I don't think you need me to elaborate on those feelings. Instead I--I wanted to share something personal and tell you that... there are people in my life who are gone now, people I miss very much and people who I am haunted by in different ways, but whether we're separated by death or merely distance, I know that they're still with me because I keep them in my heart. The truth is, in time, that's all that we're going to be to each other anyway, this population of memories, some wonderful and endearing, some less so. But taken together, those memories help make us who we are and who we will be. So whether you're here with each other now or you're merely in each other's thoughts, remember each other on that road ahead. And I hope that no matter where your travels lead you in this life... you'll always take Capeside with you. Congratulations.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Coda
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You know, I was just gonna... keep my mouth shut and let you go... but... <i>  [Sighs] </i> ... It's not me. That's some Merchant Ivory movie, you know, where people suffer in silence, and you're supposed to be so impressed by their restraint. Well... you know... sorry, but screw that. My best friend in the whole world is leaving tomorrow, and a big part of me wants him to stay... so I hope you don't hate me.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I could never hate you, Joey... and not for lack of trying, either.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : These past couple of years, it's been one big soap opera. I wouldn't take it back. I wouldn't... take any of it back, but... I'm glad that it's over. 'Cause I like the way things are now. My life being the cruel joke that it is, now that things are so nice... you're leaving.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Jo... if I thought for one second it was the right thing to do, I would stay, but it's time to go. It's time for me to get out of this room, and it's time for you to discover who you are without us. This chapter's over, Jo. I can feel it.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [With tears running down her cheeks] </i> Do you believe in magic? I never used to. I mean, how could I? 13, your mom dies. You hope against hope for--for magic, something to make it all better. It never comes, and, you know, you look to your father who's unable to overcome all of his tragic flaws. Well, no abracadabra there. And then there's Pacey. Well... any magic that was there, that ran out, didn't it? But, uh, then there's you. There's proof that someone out there is thinking of me... my friend who was with me always. It's pure magic. I guess this is pretty much just a long-winded way of saying that, um... I'm gonna miss you, Dawson.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I'm gonna miss you, too, Joey.</dd></dl>

Capeside Revisited
<dl><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : <i>  [to Joey, as Jen answers her phone] </i> So do we like this Charlie?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : We don't really know this Charlie. She seems to keep this Charlie pretty much to herself.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : I'm a little concerned. This is all sounding very <i>  Nine 1/2 Weeks </i> to me. <i>  [Jen hangs up] </i> Booty call?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Pretty much. Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Oh! I knew it.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Are you gonna go?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I don't know. I could use the snuggles.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : See, that's what I miss most about not having a boyfriend-- the snuggling. It's better than sex. If only guys knew how easy it was to make us happy.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yeah, but you know what? Even if they did know, they'd still screw it up. Snuggling to them is merely just a means to an end.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I mean, I've been seeing Charlie for a week, and the only thing that I really know about him is that his boxers are from The Gap.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Well, there are worse things, you know?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Such as?</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Well, for instance, he could be a tighty-whitey guy.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen and Joey </b> : Oh!</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Oh, good point!</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Ok. On that note... I'm gonna go to the bathroom, and when I get back, I'd like it very much if this week's episode of <i>  Sex and the City </i> had come to an end.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Ok, Charlotte.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Capeside Revisited
<dl><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : I have this theory about you. You want to hear it?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : You love academia because of the rules, and you hate relationships because of the lack of them. Joey, no one's gonna grade you on how you handle this, you know? No one's gonna come along and tell you what's expected so you know how to succeed. Relationships are messy. That's their nature. They start messy, and they end messy, and if you ever want to have another relationship in your life, you better just stop worrying about the mess.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Capeside Revisited
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You can't see them very well, can you? At night, in the city.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : <i>  [Looks at her, surprised to see her. Then he smiles] </i> What? The stars? Um, no you can't see them very well, but what the hell, I've seen them all before, right? <i>  [They pause and look at each other, then Joey smiles] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Me too.</dd></dl>

Use Your Disillusion
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [written in a book she gave to Dawson] </i> Dear Dawson, When something like this happens, you wanna reach out and grab the people around you, the ones who matter the most. The ones you take for granted all the time. And you want to take those people and hold onto them as tight as you can, tell them how precious they are to you, how knowing them makes your life better every single day that you're living it. Because when something like this happens, you realize how awful it would be if they didn't know, if they weren't aware of the profound effect they've had on your life. So, I want to take this moment to tell you that I love you, Dawson, and I'm here for you...Now, forever, and every day in between. Love, Joey.</dd></dl>

This is so romantic. It's like that movie. It's like you make him want to be a better man.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Wouldn't it be better for society if I made him want to be a better guitar player?</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Ok, it is official.

E-mail expression is the scourge of the modern age. The Internet has made it way too easy to express oneself. Ok, you have some fleeting thought. You send it. It lands with a thud in some unsuspecting person's mailbox. Said person then reads it, gets irked because you've recapped a conversation that you presumably already had. They fail to respond. You feel slighted. But if you must be one of these pathetic passive/aggressive e-mail types, far be it from me to stop you. What do you have so far?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well... I had "Dear Dawson," and then I erased it.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Why? I think that's a nice start.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I seemed cold.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : True. I mean, you did just nude-up with the guy. Oh, I'm sorry, or did you guys do it through a hole in a sheet because that's very Dawson and Joey to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Again, shut up.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Sorry. Ok, so what do you want to say?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I don't know. I mean, I don't like the way things ended, and I want him to know that I care, but I also want to hold on to my righteous indignation.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Obviously. Well, why don't you just pick up the phone and call him?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I'm afraid we'll just fall right back into our old patterns. Trust me. E-mail is a far safer alternative at the moment.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Ok, if you must do this, then I say that you go for it. You know, be gooey and be embarrassing, but most of all, just be real, Joey. Say all of the things that you can't say to his face, the whole nine.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You're right. I better get to work. But...thank you, Audrey.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : No problem, sister Christian.</dd></dl>

Well, that's cute. Are you supposed to dress yourself, or does your mommy actually want you to look like a pansy? Look around. You see these guys? Apparently, these gentlemen are free thinkers. Since you've yet to grow a pair, you get stuck with these. <i>  [Hands him a stack of folders] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : And what's all this?</dd><dd> <b>  Rich </b> : That is a collection of about 30 cold days in hell: Rich guys sittin' on piles of money so high that their daughters eloped and sold their own babies on the black market just to put ramen on the table. We have never been able to sell them stock, and they will certainly never buy it from the tardy likes of you. You better get on the phone. We work on commission here. And the guys on your list don't know how dreamy you are, so I would work that blue collar charm full-throttle. Stop battin' your eyes at me.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Is this some sort of punishment?</dd><dd> <b>  Rich </b> : I'm just tryin' to get you to leave. I don't have enough desks.</dd></dl>

I mean, I'd be flying high on a pleasingly potent cocktail of vodka and painkillers and thank you, by the way, Gail, for the painkillers. But I seem to be seeing things a little clearer than-than any of you. Dawson. Pacey. You guys hate each other, don't you? You're never going to-to be able to mend this little rift that exists between the two of you, so-so why do you even bother with the charade? And Dawson and Joey. <i>  [Laughs] </i> Here you are, both of you, all grown-up and so very pleased with yourselves and each with your little significant other by your side respectively and while I will give you that it does make for a pretty picture, the truth of the matter is that you guys finally slept together and you've never really dealt with it. And neither of you are going to be able to have a relationship with anyone else till you finally just deal with your crap once and for all. And...as for you, Pacey, I'm really sorry that Audrey Hepburn next to you broke your heart all those years ago and has prevented you from ever fully committing to an adult relationship...but you know what?

<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : <i>  [on the televisions] </i> Is this thing on? Ok, well...ahem. Hey...it's me... obviously. So if you could just step a little closer, and don't worry, I'm not gonna bite. I come in peace. Look...you and I... we're gonna be here for a while. For quite a while, it seems. So I think it would be best if we could come to some sort of truce. And to facilitate this truce, I'm willing to admit to you on camera that, yes, indeed, I am an ass, which you probably already know. Better than most people. And perhaps better than anyone on earth. But I digress. My proposal is this: That we leave the past in the past, which is where it belongs anyway, that we try and make the best out of this bad situation, and that we get comfortable. To wit--I bought you something. Well, I didn't really buy you something. Perhaps procured would be a better word, but...anyway, you get my point. It's down there on the counter. <i>  [She looks over and sees that he put a set of pajamas and slippers on the counter] </i> I'm not so sure about the sizes anymore, 'cause it's been a while, but... we can always exchange it. And, if you accept my proposal, you will have at your disposal for a limited time only the ability to make me do one thing I really do not want to do. Which is not to say that you don't always have that ability, but I kinda figure that that's how this whole night from hell started. You were doing something for me that you really didn't want to do... which is what friends are for. Ok. Over and out.</dd></dl>

In a spiritual sense. 'Cause, you know, if you found everything that you needed today, what would be the point of waking up tomorrow and doing it all over again? It just wouldn't seem worth it.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Don't worry. He's on a one-day pass from the asylum. But...in all fairness, I should let you know that I will be writing a letter to the home office about this.</dd><dd> <b>  Clerk </b> : You will?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yeah.

Find it.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Oh, right. Ok. Well, um... several months ago, I realized that I had a serious problem with alcohol. I had all these negative feelings about my life, and I was using alcohol as my escape. And in the process, I hurt a lot of people that were very close to me. And if it hadn't been for those very same people, I probably would not have gotten the professional help that I needed. So after spending several weeks in a rehab facility in southern California, um... I guess my question to you is this, Dr. Drew-- how would you like to go back to my dorm room and play a little game I like to call "dirty doctor and naughty nurse?"</dd></dl>

Catch-22
<dl><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Good morning, gentlemen. I had sex with a beautiful woman last night. Now, this should not have happened. She was way out of my league, and I even like to think that I'm a fairly handsome guy, but I'm not that handsome, and I like to think that I'm pretty good in bed, but I'm not that good. How does something like that happen? I'll tell you. I'm 20 years old, and I am doing exactly what I was put on this earth to do. I am making money... hand over fist... faster than I know how to spend it. And let's tell the truth. You all came here today because you're trying to escape the miserable bottom-feeding existence that you've been living that has denied you what is rightfully yours. If you want this for yourselves, you can have it. But I'm here to tell you, you will get your asses kicked on a daily basis, but you will learn. And ultimately, you will do what you were put on this earth to do, which is make money. Now, if any of you are still interested in this proposition, be here 9 A.M. Sharp Monday morning. If you are late, do not come into my building. Turn around, go home, and prepare yourselves for a life in retail. I'll see you then.</dd></dl>

Catch-22
<dl><dd> <b>  Eddie </b> : <i>  [in a letter to Joey] </i> Dear Joey, as you know, I'm not good at good-byes, but I guess that's what this is. A real one this time. Because as much as I thought I wanted us to be together, I guess what I want more is to be one of those people who lives every moment of his life without indecision and without regrets. Someone who dares to disturb the universe without a thought to the consequences. And you're not one of those people, at least not yet. Maybe you'll prove me wrong about that one day. I hope you do. But who knows? Maybe people can't change. Maybe we're doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again no matter how hard we try. I always hope for a happy ending. How crazy is that? Take care of yourself.</dd></dl>

Being in this room, it just takes me back to a whole other era. When the future was a clean slate for all of us, you know?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well, the room may have gone back in time, but I think you and I have moved ahead rather nicely. It's about all the obstacles we went through when we were kids. We both ended up doing exactly what we wanted to do.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, there was that brief period of time I toyed with the idea of being a rodeo clown, but I guess this'll do. Heh heh.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : But you made something of yourself, Pace, and now you're making something out of me.</dd></dl>

You're a little too hard-core for that.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, I've been reassessing how I allocate my time.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : So you're drinking?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I'm thinking about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : You're thinking about taking a tasty downward spiral? Oh, you'd better quit while you're ahead. You're not cut out for this.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : What are you talking about? I could spiral with the best of them. Speaking of... shouldn't you really avoid places like this?</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : I, um, can't hide from my problems forever. It's kind of how I ended up in rehab in the first place, right?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, that's brave of you. But you were always good like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Yeah, well, I'll be your personal superhero, ok?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Ok.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : Unless of course you want to spend the rest of your days hiding out in dives like this. What are you hiding from, Pacey?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I'm hiding from the suit, because it's evil. Bad things happen when it's on. I allowed people to believe in me for a second, which was foolish, and now it's really coming back to bite them in the ass.</dd><dd> <b>  Audrey </b> : You know what? This isn't you talking. This is your former self rearing its ugly head. Come on, Pacey. I know moments like these. One path is the harsh reality, and one path is the comfortably numb. But guess what? In the morning, when you're all sobered up, the problem's still gonna be there. Only, now it'll be like a big festering wound, and you'll just be the jerk who sat back and let it get worse.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, thanks for not walking on eggshells around me.</dd></dl>

I was kind of hoping I could just climb up the ladder and... magically fill in all the lost time.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : How's that working for you?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Not so easy.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Maybe I was gone for too long.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well, we'll piece it together between the two of us then, right? The lost year of Dawson and Joey.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : It wasn't easy.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : What wasn't?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Not talking to you. Maybe it seemed like it was. And I guess it just... became routine, just another thing that I didn't do. Well, like shooting heroin or driving drunk.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Wow, I'm up there with the dangerous activities.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Or casual sex. Dawson, for so long, you were the only person in the whole world I wanted to be with. Then somehow you became my only one-night stand.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I never meant for it to be like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I know. I know. Maybe being in this room makes it easier. Having it set up this way, you know, I'm so familiar, and... seems insane not to talk. And sometimes the hardest things to say are the things that... really matter.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Hmm. Why do you think I've spent years trying to write an entire screenplay about you?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I read it in one sitting.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Ok. I hope you don't think that I gave it to you so that you could just say all the obligatory nice things.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : And why would I feel obligated?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Exactly, because if I can't get an honest opinion from the girl who loathes me more than anyone else in the world, who can I trust, right?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You've always been this devilishly clever.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well... yeah. But... uh, I got--I got-- I wanted you to read it because... well, you're really the only person in the world who can tell me if I got it right this time.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You grew up, Dawson. You grew up. I always wanted to think that you were this hopeless dreamer and I was the adult that escaped. But I didn't escape anything, not really.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Sure you did. You got out of Capeside. Wasn't that the original plan?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Couldn't escape myself, could I? You were right. So much of what I was fighting was growing up. And I figured out this past year that it's hard for me... to talk about sex, to talk about... getting close with someone. And maybe... I'm not supposed to lose myself. Now it's not part of the plan. But then again, I never thought that losing you was part of the plan, either.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I think sometimes... you have to lose somebody completely before you can figure out what they really mean to you. I missed you, Jo.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You got it right this time, Dawson. I missed us.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You ok, Pace?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : You don't have to do this.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Do what?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Sit out here with me. I know you'd rather be in the house with Dawson, so why don't you just go and help him lick his wounds?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Things never change here, do they?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : No... because these are the roles we were destined to play.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : No, Pace, these are the roles we chose to play. I mean, look at us, sitting out here on this dock in front of the same house we've been haunting for years. We're practically ghosts of our former selves, and honestly, I don't think anyone really remembers what they're mad about anymore.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Mm, I wouldn't be so sure about that.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Pacey, if I wanted to go back into that house, I would've gone a long time ago. Don't you know me at all by now?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, I don't want you sitting here feeling sorry for me.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I don't feel sorry for you. I <i>  feel </i> for you, Pacey. God, can't you ever tell the difference?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I don't know. <i>  [Sighs] </i> I don't know, because you and I have had a very confusing run of things. Especially lately.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Ok. You know, and no matter how much I love you or how long I stay with you, you're only gonna remember the moments when I leave.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well, you gotta give me that much, because those are pretty much the most painful moments in my life.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : That's because you ask for them, Pacey. I'm sorry. You do. Your whole life, you spend so much time expecting the worst that you don't even notice the moments when people are loving you, and, Pacey, people spend a lot of time loving you.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Well... with all due respect, Jo, my best friend just walked away from me, but that's not even the worst of it. The worst thing is he hasn't even really known me for the last 3 years, so please, clarify that for me. How does that qualify me as a man with a support network?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well, you have a person sitting right here, don't you? But of course, that's not enough. Not until you let it.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : In what world do I have you?</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Look, just because I don't fit into that... place you want me to doesn't mean there's not a place for me, Pacey. Does it?</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : Joey, this isn't your fight, anyway.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You're right. You're right. It's not my fight because it's been over for a really long time, Pacey. And it is up to you to make it right.</dd><dd> <b>  Pacey </b> : I don't know how to make it right.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Well, you're gonna have to figure it out. You know, that's the thing about ghosts. They say that... they don't leave until they're at peace with what they left undone.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Joey Potter and Capeside Redemption
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I used to be afraid of so many things...That I'd never grow up. That I'd be trapped in the same place for all eternity. That my dreams would forever be shy of my reach. It's true what they say. Time plays tricks on you. One day you're dreaming, the next your dream has become your reality. And now that this scared little girl no longer follows me wherever I go, I miss her. I do. 'Cause there are things I wanna tell her-- to relax, to lighten up, that it is all going to be ok. I want her to know that meeting people who like you, who understand you, who actually accept you for who you are, will become an increasingly rare occurrence. Jen, Jack, Audrey, Andie, Pacey, and Dawson. These people who contributed to who I am, they are with me wherever I go, and as history gets rewritten in small ways with each passing day, my love for them only grows. Because the truth is... it was the best of times. Mistakes were made, hearts were broken, harsh lessons learned, but all of that has receded into fond memory now. How does it happen? Why are we so quick to forget the bad and romanticize the good? Maybe it's because we need to believe that the time we spent together actually meant something, that we were there for each other in a time in our lives that defined us all, a time in our lives that we will never forget. I can't swear this is exactly how it happened. But this is how it felt.</dd></dl>
Season 6
All Good Things...
<dl><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : Looks like somebody's in quite the hurry this morning.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Sheriff Doug, hey, look, I'm sorry. I'm late and I'm trying to get to class.</dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : Well, I have no choice but to issue you a citation for doing 40 in a 25.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Look, I already have all these points against my license. You think maybe there's something I could do to...get you to look the other way.</dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : May I remind you, Mr. McPhee, that attempting to bribe a public official is a serious offense?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Uh, you know, I was just hoping that maybe, um... I could appeal to your greater sense of compassion?</dd><dd> <i>  [Doug leans in and kisses him] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : All right. Just this once, I'll let you go with a warning.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Thanks, honey.</dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : No, no, never, never call me honey.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Dude, it's a deserted road. Chill.</dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : Don't call me dude, either.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : All right, tonight? Dinner later?</dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : Yeah. I'll cook. My place.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Great. I'll bring the handcuffs. Kidding. I'll see you.</dd><dd> <b>  Doug </b> : Yeah, I'll see you. Jack... slow down.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You got it.</dd></dl>
Season 6
All Good Things...
<dl><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Mr. Hampton... is there a problem?</dd><dd> <b>  Hampton </b> : Do I have to keep reading?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Well, the poem's not finished.</dd><dd> <b>  Hampton </b> : No, offense, Mr. McPhee, but this is a poem by a guy about another guy. It's, like, a gay poem.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I wasn't aware that poems had sexual orientation. See, this gay poem and others like it actually got Whitman fired from his job. See, he was an outcast most of his life. But he didn't care. He loved his country. He loved the freedom that it stood for, and he celebrated the American spirit every chance that he got. And here we are 150 years later, and we're still laughing at him. Your assignment for this weekend is to find a way to say, through the conventions of poetry, what you are afraid to say. I want you guys to write about something that you're scared of. We're gonna read these things out loud on Monday to each other, so I would hope that you give the same courtesy to each other that you did not give to Mr. Whitman today. Have a good weekend.</dd></dl>
Season 6
All Good Things...
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : So I just caught some of your act. Looks like Capeside finally hired a good teacher.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Good teachers are just traumatized students trying to erase whatever went wrong with their own high school experience.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Do you think that you could erase my memories while you're at it?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : That would be a lifetime in a nunnery.</dd></dl>
Season 6
All Good Things...
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : What are you doing here? It's late. Doesn't this hospital have visitation hours?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I, uh... flirted with a nurse. I can be quite charming when I want to be.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : What happens when she finds out you're gay?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : It's a male nurse.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Cute?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Look, Jen... I would love nothing more than to engage in our patented, meaningless, good-humored Jack-Jen fag-hag banter, but... first I was kinda wondering, I mean, since you're lying here in this hospital bed and you're hooked up to all these machines... how come? How come you didn't tell me, 'cause I thought I was your best friend?</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Because I didn't want you to be worried. I was already worrying enough. Because I thought that if I pretended it didn't exist, it would just go away. Because I like it. I like our... patented, meaningless fag-hag banter, and 'cause I was scared if I said it out loud, it would be true, because I was just-- I was just scared. 'Cause I was an idiot.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You are an idiot. I--I could've handled it. I could've helped you handle it.</dd><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : Well, you will help me handle it. I need you.</dd></dl>
Season 6
...Must Come to an End
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : <i>  [on videotape] </i> Hi, Amy, it's mom. Well, by the time you see this, I won't be here anymore, and I know how much that sucks, for both of us. So seeing as how I won't be around to thoroughly annoy you, I thought I would give you a little list of the things that I wish for you. Well, there's the obvious. An education. Family. Friends. And a life that is full of the unexpected. Be sure to make mistakes. Make a lot of them, because there's no better way to learn and to grow, all right? And, um, I want you to spend a lot of time at the ocean, because the ocean forces you to dream, and I insist that you, my girl, be a dreamer. God. I've never really believed in god. In fact, I've spent a lot of time and energy trying to disprove that god exists. But I hope that you are able to believe in god, because the thing that I've come to realize, sweetheart... is that it just doesn't matter if god exists or not. The important thing is for you to believe in something, because I promise you that that belief will keep you warm at night, and I want you to feel safe always. And then there's love. I want you to love to the tips of your fingers, and when you find that love, wherever you find it, whoever you choose, don't run away from it. But you don't have to chase after it either. You just be patient, and it'll come to you, I promise, and when you least expect it, like you, like spending the best year of my life with the sweetest and the smartest and the most beautiful baby girl in the world. You don't be afraid, sweetheart. And remember, to love means to live.</dd></dl>
Season 6
...Must Come to an End
<dl><dd> <b>  Jen </b> : I mean, from the second that I stepped out of that cab and onto the Creek, I--I was the instigator, you know? The girl who caused problems and rocked the creek and upset the delicate emotional balance of Capeside, and--and I don't want Amy to be that person. I want her to belong. I feel like I never really did.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Jen you belong. You belong with me. Don't you get it? You're my soulmate. Amy's gonna know love. Every day of her life, she is gonna know how much her mother loved her. I'm gonna see to that.</dd></dl>
Season 6
...Must Come to an End
<dl><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Are you writing?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : No. The curse of an unwritten ending.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Oh. Make it a happy one, please. I can't take any more sad ones. Stay away from the life and death of it all.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : It's interesting how people use that expression-- life and death. As if to imply that life is the opposite of death, but birth is the opposite of death. Life... has no opposite.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : I never thought of it that way.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Well, leave it to me to over think it.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : You <i>  are </i> the writer.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : Yeah. This writer has decided it doesn't matter how it ends... because fiction is fiction, and for the first time, in a long time... My life is real. It doesn't matter who ends up with who. Because in some unearthly way... it's always gonna be you and me.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Soul mates.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : What we have goes beyond friendship, beyond lovers. It's forever.</dd><dd> <b>  Joey </b> : Yes, it is. I love you, Dawson.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawson </b> : I love you, too, Joey.</dd></dl>
