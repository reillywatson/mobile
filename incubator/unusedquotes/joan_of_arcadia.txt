<dl><dd> <b>  Ms. Bloome: </b> When I was 29 I was in a car accident and I died. And no, I don't remember a tunnel. I didn't see any dead loved ones, no angels. Nothing like that. It's just that when I woke up, everything was different. I was different. I asked the doctor, and he said this was not uncommon among near-death survivors. And then shortly after that, I began having dreams that came true. And weird visions. It was like I could hear peoples thoughts. I don't know the why of it, but I made the decisions that as long as I had this bizarre ability, I might as well use it to help people. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Will: </b> And get paid for it. Help people for a price. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Ms. Bloome: </b> Yeah, like you. Is it because of the tragedy? I mean that this makes you so angry and unwilling.

<dl><dd> <b>  Helen: </b> It's just... I was raised Catholic and I was taught that you don't ask God for specific things, but there is this one miracle that I would really, really like to have. Like something you see in a store and you can't stop thinking about it, and you start to believe that it already belongs to you, and it's just misplaced, but is it wrong? Can it actually do harm to pray for something you want? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Priest: </b> I think prayer can never hurt. As long as you understand you might not recognize the answer right away. Most miracles occur in hindsight. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Helen: </b> Why don't I ever feel better after I talk to you? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Priest: </b> I don't know. <br /></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Because my life is completely unraveling. I'm up to my eyeballs in the drama of the high school mating ritual, and now, thanks to you, I've been mistaken as the school chess champion. How did this happen to me? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Which part? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> How did I beat that kid at chess? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> He was using logic. You weren't. It's impossible to guard against chaos. It's rare, but it happens. Black's move. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> I don't want to... I don't know how to play this game. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> And yet you play the game. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Because I'm forced to. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Forced to? Your friends make a suggestion, which you follow up on, and then you're surprised at the outcome? It's a causal universe. Move. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Wait a minute, I'm being punished because I made a tiny little effort to fit in? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> It's not about punishment. It's that actions have consequences, and to be in denial of that is to be disengaged from the laws of the universe, which renders you powerless and vulnerable to an inordinate amount of pain. Other than that, it's no big deal... move.... (She touches one of the pieces and then changes her mind)No.... <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> No? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> It's a rule called "touch move." Once you touch a piece, you have to move that piece. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> I'm not allowed to change my mind? What kind of universe is that? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Oh, you can change your mind, but you still have to play that piece. So you should think before you move. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Wait a minute, this is a metaphor... Yeah, I looked up "metaphor" and that's definitely an example... Yep... took the bait. So now I'm in the game. How do I get out? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> There are many ways to get out; surrender is one, losing is another. Winning, cheating, which I don't recommend, but you have to do something. You have to have a strategy. See the number one rule in chess is this; whatever you do, don't play the other person's game. Play your own... Your move. <br /></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> So, I was in the "in" crowd. I just got to see the jerks closer up. Why do you think I spent so much time playing sports? I didn't like that social thing so much. People were mean, it was boring. I wanted to play my own game. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Oh my god! Somebody just said that to me yesterday. About chess. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> Well, it's the basic rule of any sport. Otherwise you're always on the defensive posture, always reacting to the other guy. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> You really weren't happy in high school? You really felt like a reject sometimes? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> Everybody does. Even the ones who claim they don't. You-- you are going to find some people who totally get what a non-repulsive, sub-defective you are. Trust in yourself a little bit, you'll figure it out. And if you need me to roll over anyone, let me know. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Sub-defective. <br /></dd></dl>

Why would you turn that down? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Because I don't know how to play chess. I keep telling everybody that but no one believes it. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> I believe you. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Thank you. I don't understand it. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> It's just strategy and a little bit of living in the future. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Will: </b> Please, no more talk about the future. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> That's how it works, Dad. I mean, you see four moves ahead, it's empirical. You see five moves ahead, it's still grounded in science. I mean, who knows where the demarcation is? Now, if you see twelve moves ahead, maybe you're crossing over into psychic phenomenon. And maybe that's what a psychic does. She just sees the board of life better then we do. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Will: </b> There are a million people with white cars and dogs. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> [Interrupting to make a point] She said I'd dance at my wedding. That's what she told me. Then again, she said Joan has a special connection to the universe, so go figure. <br /></dd></dl>

But the moose is basing his whole assessment on what appears to be questionable evidence.</dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> Like his horns are kinda small?</dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> Actually, it's more of a behavioral observation.

Isn't that one of those geek powers you always used to wish for? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> [To the clerk] Is this the strongest magnet you've got? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Clerk: </b> Uh, yeah. $6.49. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> [To Luke] That's $6.49 you could have saved.

I mean, he's got it tough. Poor bastard. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> Ok. See, what you're doing right there, you might as well spit on him. It even makes me want to steal from you.

Season One
The Devil Made Me Do It
<dl><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> [Knocking on the door frame] I brought you the stuff you needed. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> The stuff you bought for me, you mean? I don't need it. I'm getting rid of all my toys. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> Well, scale models are not toys. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> It's time for me to grow up. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> I wasn't aware that was something you could just decide. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> I was the perfect big brother. Come on, admit it. I'm stronger, faster, better-looking. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> Well, not better-looking. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> It's a reality, kid. Face it. People were nice to you because you were Kevin Girardi's kid brother. Probably kept you from being beat up about a hundred times. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> I do seem to attract threats of violence. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> Last night, the natural order was reversed. You were the Big Brother. You were smarter and stronger and tougher. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> And better-looking? <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> I'm the big brother in this family, in or out of the wheelchair, so get off of my cloud. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> The cloud reference eludes me. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> Yesterday... that will not happen again. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> Are you apologizing to me? No, no, of course not. Why--why would you? It's an explanation, and that's enough. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> If you can't get your money back, I'll reimburse you. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> Well, that's ok. Of course. Yes, I can use the money. And you're fully capable. <br /></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> You're going to be proud of me again. <br /></dd></dl>

St. Joan
<dl><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> For God's sake, I can't stand it. Can we - can we please just talk about the gigantic stain on the carpet? We've been dancing around it for almost two years now, and it's making me crazy and maybe it's why I'm pissed off all the time. 'Cause no one will say it out loud, so I have to. The accident: it was my fault. This is my fault. The guys and I were out partying after the game. My friend Andy was wasted. I tried to take his keys. He got pissed off. I was afraid of not being cool so I went for the ride. I went for the ride. So, here we all are. I did this. I did do it. The Universe didn't conspire; the planets didn't align against me. Can somebody just please say it out loud? <b>  I did this! </b></dd></dl>

Drive, He Said
<dl><dd> <i>  [Kevin is waiting for the bathroom] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> Ok, Joan, here's the thing: it's the face you were born with - there's only so much you can do.</dd></dl>

Season One
Drive, He Said
<dl><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> I don't want to drive. Why are you making me?</dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Most young people want to drive. Why are you so hesitant?</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Well you know everything. Why don't you tell me?</dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Perhaps your mother is correct. You're afraid of hurting yourself and ending up like Kevin.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Yeah, maybe she's right.</dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Balderdash! You've always been a headstrong, brave child not overly concerned with your own well-being - a trait you inherited from your father. What you fear is hurting someone else. You fear that one instance of bad judgement might entail consequences. Consequences like those...</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Like Kevin? That's... that's why I don't want to drive. I mean, isn't that... isn't that a pretty good reason?</dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Being an adult isn't merely about risking your own well-being, it means risking others' - in cars, in love, in family - hurting others is always a possibility. That's what's difficult about being an adult: facing the harsh fact that you may hurt others even when you don't want to.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Then it's a flaw in the design, and who's fault is that?</dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> It might help if you think of the Universe as an obstacle course. There's no flaw in the design, it's just -</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Obstacles?</dd><dd> <b>  God: </b> Time's up.</dd></dl>
Season One
The Uncertainty Principle
<dl><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> So I asked Grace to do this thing with me, and, at the time, she said "yes". Sort of. But...</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Wait, Grace Polk said yes to you?</dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> It was somewhat contingent, but, essentially, yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Huh, you're so gonna get it.</dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> But see, I don't know if she actually remembers me asking, so do I - do I have to do the full reapproach, or...?</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> What is she going to wear, because they don't make gowns out of fatigues.</dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> What are we talking about?</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> You asked Grace Polk to the semi-formal.</dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> I asked her to be my partner in the science fair.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Wow. Science really is like sex to you.</dd></dl>
Season One
State of Grace
<dl><dd> <b>  Grace: </b> Y'know, this whole debate is a joke.</dd><dd> <b>  Friedman: </b> I have a very strong rebuttal.</dd><dd> <b>  Grace: </b> Like it matters? No matter what happens in this debate, those metal detectors will still be there. They will still stop us and search us.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Price: </b> I would like you to leave, Miss Polk.</dd><dd> <b>  Grace: </b> Oh, gee, remember free speech, Mr. Price?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Enfield: </b> Remember decorum? Manners? Civility?</dd><dd> <b>  Grace: </b> Yeah, all the things that used to keep us down? Well guess what, today is about freedom.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> You call what you are doing right now free speech?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Enfield: </b> You're not debating this young woman, Miss Girardi. I suggest you not deviate from the rules.</dd><dd> <b>  Friedman: </b> <i>  [In undertone to Glynis] </i> We're so gonna win this debate.</dd><dd> <b>  Grace: </b> That's right, Girardi. Party line - that's what it's about.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Price: </b> Alright, out!</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> And what's it about for you, Grace? Your idea of freedom is a world where everyone agrees with you?</dd><dd> <b>  Grace: </b> You believe in this crap?</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> I don't know what I believe. I know Ramsey came in here with a gun. I know people could have died - you, me. You said I think like this becasue my father's a cop? Like that's bad? Yeah, my dad is a cop and you may think that makes him some kind of bigot, but he deals with those guns every day. This is not some political thing for him, this is reality. He's had them pointed at him and shoved in his face and that makes it real for me too, because every time I hear that the cops are in someplace and shots are fired, I wonder if I'm ever going to see my father again. I don't think we should have to, like, live in some prison - that sucks - but I do know we have to deal with this. We have to work something out. Even if it's not what we sort of believe in in the first place. I know I'm mouthing off, Mr Enfield, and I can't cite some report to back up my theories. I - this is just how I feel.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> It's just that, I like Adam.</dd><dd> <b>  Helen: </b> I know, honey.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Mom, please. I know you think I'm dating him but I'm not. I mean, we kissed once (and, please, never repeat that to me or anyone else because I'm already grossed out I told you,) but it was just a kiss. You know, just a one-time kiss.</dd><dd> <b>  Helen: </b> Okay.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> It doesn't mean we're dating, does it?</dd><dd> <b>  Helen: </b> Well -</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Right, I know, of course not. It's just I think Adam thought that it did and he was kinda ... y'know, about it. And I - I - I was sort of ... y'know, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Helen: </b> Oh...</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> And now he likes someone else - this, Iris (huh) - and I don't know what he sees in her. I mean, she's all... y'know. I want him to be happy; I'm not one of those people who gets all perky when someone else is miserable (maybe I am), but - but I do think Adam should be happy. Just not before I'm happy. I mean, he can be happy with someone else after I'm happy with someone else. (Does that make me a total maggot? Whatever.) The real question is: should I try to get him back? I mean, what if he falls in love with her and I realize that I do like him and it's too late but if I break them up and get him back but realize that I really don't want to be with him then he's going to hate me again, which I could not stand because I really like him. <i>  [Sighs] </i> There's just no good answer here.</dd><dd> <b>  Helen: </b> Honey, you are dealing with a lot of emotions.</dd><dd> <b>  Joan: </b> Mom, I can't have this conversation right now, okay?</dd></dl>

You're not that guy anymore and never will be again. <i>  [Pause] </i> I'm - I'm sorry.</dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> What's your problem? The more things that go my way, the more pissed off you get. What's that about?</dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> I said, "I'm sorry," okay? It won't happen again.</dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> Yes it will. What do you and your science friends call that - Law of Inertia? What is it?</dd><dd> <i>  [Kevin punches Luke again] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Kevin: </b> What's the problem, Luke?</dd><dd> <b>  Luke: </b> THAT! Right there. Do you have any idea how much I hated you for shoving me and hitting me and making fun of me all the time? And no one would say anything about it because you were the big star and I was just a geek. You know, after your accident, when I heard you'd never walk again, I was happy.</dd></dl>
