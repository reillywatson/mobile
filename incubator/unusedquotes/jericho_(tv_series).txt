<dl><dd> <b>  Stanley </b> : This is a big day! You get to be an accountant again. Account things, add things up, maybe even a little subtraction, right?</dd><dd> <b>  Mimi </b> : I have to say, I cannot wait to work in that office. You wouldn't believe how organized the Jennings and Rall people are. Everything is bar-coded. I have so missed bar-codes and spreadsheets. I mean every component and package and foodstuff, every ounce is accounted for; where's its been and where its going. Oh, I had forgotten how beautiful order can be.</dd><dd> <b>  Stanley </b> : That's probably the most boring story I've heard in months.</dd></dl>

Season 2
Condor[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Tomarchio </b> : You've lost loved ones, and here you are again; still strong, still proud. This is the best of America. But infighting has left us weak and vulnerable to our enemies. Remnants of the old Federal government has fallen back to Columbus, Ohio. After the attacks that government endlessly debated our response. So, in a vacuum of leadership I acted to let the world know that America was down, but not out! The Federal government of the eastern block states no longer has any governing authority beyond the Mississippi. You've seen the flag. This is the flag of a new country, flying from the Mississippi to the Pacific. The thirteen stripes of red and white still represent the thirteen colonies, but they run in a new direction, just as we must chart a new direction for ourselves. In a few short weeks Mayor Anderson will represent you as we ratify a constitution for this new nation, that will be known to the world by a new name; The Allied States of America! And with this new name, a clean slate. Our debts have been forgiven, and we are open again for business. That means jobs, stocked shelves, a return to life as we knew it. And in the fall we'll have elections where we can all take part in building a new government, as a safer, stronger America. God bless you, and God bless the Allied States of America!</dd></dl>

Oversight[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Deputy Sheriff Kohler </b> : It's Fort Knox back there.</dd><dd> <b>  Jake </b> : What is that?</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Sheriff Kohler </b> : Thumb-print scanner. Getting that room ready to house 'classified' information, pretty short list of people that will have access.</dd><dd> <b>  Jake </b> : Let me guess, I'm not on it?</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Sheriff Kohler </b> : But, if it's any consolation, you now hold the distinction of being the first Jericho sheriff, in history, who doesn't have a key to the sheriff's office.</dd></dl>

Oversight[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jake </b> : Stanley asked me to return this to you. <i>  [hands over bottle of alcohol] </i> Find another way into town, quit using his property.</dd><dd> <b>  Dale </b> : It's the safest way in.</dd><dd> <b>  Jake </b> : It's not a suggestion, Dale.</dd></dl>

Season 2
Sedition[2.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jake </b> : It's not about convincing one man he's wrong. It's a whole system.</dd><dd> <b>  E. J. Green </b> : You think it's impossible? This has all happened before. If the names weren't Jennings &amp; Rall, they would be names like... the British East India Trading Company. If it wasn't Ravenwood, it'd be the Hessian Mercenaries. And it all comes down to the same thing...</dd><dd> <b>  Jake </b> : Revolution.</dd></dl>
