[Begins to daydream] She was my dream, my muse, a vision suitable for the wide screen format. I can still taste her fist against my face, the sweet sugary sweat from a lifetime of diabetes.

<dl><dd> <b>  Narrarator </b> : Early's tenure as CEO of Dan Halen International had not been long, but it had been distinguished. By drunkenness, hair-trigger violence, and a total lack of performance. I would call it a steady decline in performance, but that would imply that he performed at one point in time.
