You know, and I think when you're somewhere you ought to be there, and because it's not about how long you stay in a place.

The Aurora Borealis[1.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Bernard </b> : Those Northern Lights are some kind of weird psychic, something?</dd><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Bernard </b> : What causes them to do that?</dd><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : Well, this is just my guess, but I think that high speed electrons and protons from the sun are trapped in the van Allen radiation belt. Then they're channeled through the Polar Regions by the earth's magnetic field where they collide with other particles and create a brilliant luminosity.</dd><dd> <b>  Bernard </b> : What does that have to do with us?</dd><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : I swear man, I don't know.</dd></dl>

Season 3
Dateline: Cicely[3.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : Rain usually makes me feel mellow. Curl up in the corner time, slow down, smell the furniture. Today it just makes me feel wet. What is it about possessing things? Why do we feel the need to own what we love, and why do we become jerks when we do? We've all been there--you want something, to possess it. By possessing something you lose it. You finally win the girl of your dreams, the first thing you do is change her. The little things she does with her hair, the way she wears her clothes or the way she chews her gum.

Season 4
The Big Feast[4.21]
<dl><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : Maurice J. Minnifield, our generous host, friend, and employer. I'm sure I join everyone in saying thank you for these very fine eats and drinks. You are a real American. You're an ex-marine and astronaut, you are America. You're rich, you're rapacious, you're progress without a conscience, paving everything in its path. You're 5% of the earth's population, yet consuming 25% of the earth's natural resources. You pay a lot of taxes, you do a lot of charity work--most of it is tax deductible, but your heart is in the right place. One thing's for certain, you have impeccable taste in the booze.</dd></dl>

We see a logging truck go cruising down the road, stacked with a bunch of those fresh-cut giants, we feel like we lost a brother. Next thing you know, we're in The Brick, we're flopping money down on the bar. Wood. We're under a roof. Wood. We're walking the floors. Wood. Grabbing a pool cue. That's wood. Our friends in the forest carry a set of luggage from the mythical baggage carousel. Tree of life, tree of knowledge, family tree, Budda's Bodhi tree. Page one of life, in the beginning. Genesis 3:22. Adam and Eve. They're kicking back in the garden of Eden and boom, they get an eviction notice. Why is that? "Lest they should also take of the tree of life, eat and live forever." A definitive Yahweh no-no. Be good to yourself Cicely, go out and plant a wet one on a tree.</dd></dl>

Ant. All of you, you're all a bunch of little, busy, blind ants. All you all. Saving up for your rainy days. Scratching up your acorns for the winter. You look at me and you think, "What a piece of pathetic trash out there in that leaky trailer." No spoon, no fork, no prospects. But, you know why? Cause I'm a grasshopper. Ant. Grasshopper. Ant.

But, uh -</dd><dd> <b>  Maurice </b> : But what?</dd><dd> <b>  Ed </b> : Well, it's just that he's a little easier to talk to.</dd><dd> <b>  Maurice </b> : The statue?</dd><dd> <b>  Ed </b> : Well, he doesn't throw my thoughts off like you do sometimes.</dd><dd> <b>  Maurice </b> : I don't throw your thoughts off, son! What are you talking about?</dd><dd> <b>  Ed </b> : Well, kind of like now, Maurice.</dd><dd> <b>  Maurice </b> : I'm not in the business of throwing people's thoughts off! Is that clear?</dd></dl>

And when you hear the wind, you'll fly." So he stopped talking. And became its nature, the Eagle. The Eagle soared, and its flight said all it needed to say</dd></dl>
Season 5
Rosebud[5.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : The path to our destination is not always a straight one, Ed. We go down the wrong road, we get lost, we turn back. Maybe it doesn't matter which road we embark on. Maybe what matters is that we embark.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Heal Thyself[5.08]

First Snow[5.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : Oh the snow the beautiful snow filling the sky and earth below. Over the house tops and over the streets, over the heads of people you meet. Dancing flirting skimming along. Oh the snow the beautiful snow how the flakes gather and laugh as they go. Whirling about in their maddening fun it plays in its glee with everyone. Chasing laughing hurrying by it lights on the face and sparkles the eye. And even the dogs with a bark and a bound snap at the crystals that eddy around. The town is alive and its heart in a glow to welcome the coming of beautiful snow. Bon Hiver Cicely.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Maggie </b> : Life is everywhere. The earth is throbbing with it, it's like music. The plants, the creatures, the ones we see, the ones we don't see, it's like one, big, pulsating symphony.</dd></dl>
Season 5
A Bolt From the Blue[5.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Adam </b> : You think Nature is some Disney movie? Nature is a killer. Nature is a bitch. It's feeding time out there 24 hours a day, every step that you take is a gamble with death. If it isn't getting hit with lightning today, it's an earthquake tomorrow or some deer tick carrying Lyme disease. Either way, you're ending up on the wrong end of the food chain.</dd></dl>
Season 5
A Bolt From the Blue[5.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Joel </b> : I know Adam is a walking pathology, but the guy's never hurt anybody, not that I know of. I mean, threats of imminent danger are just his way of saying "good morning."</dd></dl>

Una Volta in L'Inverno[5.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : Morning Cicely. 8:00 A.M. muchachos. Time to finish those flapjacks, knock back that second cup of joe, get ready to greet the day. Temperature's creeping towards double digits as the solar drought continues--23 days, an average of an hour and a half of sunlight every day. No relief on the horizon. Which only makes sense cause there is no horizon. Our friends at the weather service are calling for another storm and as we know, they've been batting a thousand lately. Hey, let's check our social calendar. Nothing. Total blank. It's cabin fever season people, that time of year when four walls feel like they're going to come in here and choke the spirit right out of you. Time to lock away those firearms and hang tough. No way through it except to do it.</dd></dl>

Season 5
A Wing and a Prayer[5.20]

I Feel the Earth Move[5.21]
<dl><dd> <b>  Chris </b> : Marriage. Why do we do it? Everybody knows the stats. One in two marriages end up in broken dishes and a trip to Tijuana. Is it loneliness? Partly. Is it teamwork? Definitely. Things just kind of go easier when there's two of you. One of you can wait in line at the movie theater while the other guy parks the car. Get better seats that way. Better room rate when it's a double. Are you ready to file jointly?...Above you is the sun and sky. Below you, the ground. Like the sun, your love should be constant, like the ground, solid. Are you both OK with that? In that case, I now pronounce you, married.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Gran Prix[5.22]
<dl><dd> <b>  Little Green Man </b> : Ed, you're dealing with the demon of external validation. You can't beat external validation. You want to know why? Because it feels sooo good.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Lovers and Madmen[5.24]
<dl><dd> <b>  Joel </b> : First I thought it was numbness, you know, shock. The inability to believe that a just God could allow someone to destroy a gold mine of prehistoric knowledge for a year's worth of Salisbury steak. I feel like I am floating. Like I'm watching myself leave my body. I think about what happened today and I just, I want to laugh. I should be foaming at the mouth like any other normal person. Maybe what I am experiencing is a euphoria you're supposed to feel just before you give up, you know, just let the lounges fill with water. Life is a mystery. One man's life-altering experience is another man's tenderloin. I'm one of you now. I'm a Cicelean.</dd></dl>

Tranquility Base (Our Town)[6.23]
