Season 1
Pilot[1.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  Goodman </b> : I do not view you as property, Dr. Brennan. You are one of the Jeffersonian's most valuable assets.</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : An asset is, by definition, property.</dd><dd> <b>  Goodman </b> : What's the rule, Mr. Addy?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : You only converse with PhDs. You do realize I'm halfway through two doctorates. Two halves make a whole, so mathematically speaking...</dd><dd> <b>  Goodman </b> : Go polish a bone, Mr. Addy.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : What if Booth is right? What if I'm only good with bones and lousy with people?</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : People like you.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I don't care if men like me.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Okay, interesting jump from "people" to "men," but I'm sure it means nothing.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I hate psychology. My most meaningful relationships are with dead people.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Man in the S.U.V.[1.2]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : We're dealing with someone here who devalues an entire culture: terrorizing people by using God to justify mass murder.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You're making it personal. That doesn't help.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : It <i>  is </i> personal, Bones. All of us die a little bit on one like this.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Man in the S.U.V.[1.2]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Okay, what's so funny?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I just never figured you being in a relationship.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Why? Do you think something's wrong with me?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Not wrong. You just have alpha male attributes usually associated with a solitary existence.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : What, me? You're solitary.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : No, no, I'm private.</dd></dl>

Season 1
The Boy in the Tree[1.3]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Ah, you know, I'm glad we had that little chat about being nice to the locals.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I don't like sheriffs. They are elected into office, which means their goal is being re-elected, not finding the truth.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Boy in the Tree[1.3]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : I don't... I don't like people who think they're better than other people.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Some people are better than other people.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Uh, you know what you said right there, that is so un-American. All men are created equal; either you believe that or you don't.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Some people are smarter than others; there's no use being offended by the fact. What are we going to tell Nestor's parents?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : We tell them that their son was found dead. "We're looking into it. Sorry for your loss," and we are.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Sorry for their loss. It's sad. Try to remember that.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Uh, I'm not a sociopath.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You're bad with people, okay. No use being offended by the fact.</dd></dl>

The Man in the Bear[1.4]

Season 1
The Man in the Bear[1.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You're a smart ass, you know that?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Objectively I'd say I'm very smart, although it has nothing to do with my ass.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Man in the Bear[1.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : All I am saying is, why cut somebody into pieces?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : Pack'em up tighter; maybe, say, in a suitcase.</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : How did a bear open a suitcase?</dd><dd> <b>  Zach </b> : I saw a documentary once where a bear got into a car and drove away.</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : That was not a documentary. It was a cartoon.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sherman </b> : Did you ever hear of the bone gatherers, collecting bones so that the dead can make their journey to the next world?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Not even sure I believe in the next world.</dd><dd> <b>  Sherman </b> : Doesn't matter what you believe in. You're a bone gatherer. That's a good thing, helping the spirits move on.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Thank you. It's probably the best job description I will ever get.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Man in the Bear[1.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Did you work all night?</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : Yes, I shaved the truffle.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Is that anything like spanking the monkey?</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : I found boring dust.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Is there any other kind?</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : Boring dust is produced by beetles, which means the tree the truffle grew on was infested.</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : That's not going to impress Toni.</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : That's not why I did it. I did it to serve justice and capture a murderous cannibal.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : That'll impress the hot courier.</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : I am back in the game.</dd></dl>

A Boy In a Bush[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cop </b> : You mind if I make an observation?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : No, of course not.</dd><dd> <b>  Cop </b> : In your book, the cops come off as very one-dimensional. Why is that?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You mean two-dimensional.</dd><dd> <b>  Zack: </b> One-dimensionality exists only in theory as a mathematical value.</dd><dd> <b>  Cop </b> : O-kay. Really looking forward to your next book.</dd></dl>
Season 1
A Boy In a Bush[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Goodman </b> : When I said you should think of this invitation as a summons, I understated it. It's a subpoena, a Grand Jury subpoena.

Season 1
A Boy In a Bush[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Zach </b> : These are the smallest remains I've ever worked on.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : That's a valid observation, Zach, but it's not helpful to the investigation.</dd><dd> <b>  Zach </b> : Sorry, Dr. Brennan.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I was at Waco. Branch Davidian compound. I helped identify children who had been killed in the fire, seventeen of them.</dd><dd> <b>  Zach </b> : So you're saying I'll get used to it?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : No, I'm saying you will never get used to it. We're primates, social creatures. It's coded into our DNA to protect our young, even from each other.</dd><dd> <b>  Zach </b> : So I'm always going to feel terrible?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : What helps me is to pull back emotionally. Just... put your heart in a box.</dd><dd> <b>  Zach </b> : I'm not good with metaphor, Dr. Brennan.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan: </b> Focus on the details.</dd><dd> <b>  Zach </b> : Details, yeah. I can do that.</dd></dl>

A Boy In a Bush[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I'm afraid Angela might quit.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : I'm amazed she stuck it out this long.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Well, because she's human. I'm sorry, Bones, it's just that, you know, Angela didn't get the same training the rest of you got on Planet Vulcan .</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Do you remember me, Sean?</dd><dd> <b>  Sean Cook </b> : You're the museum lady, the one who's so smart.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yeah, I'm pretty smart.</dd><dd> <b>  Attorney </b> : <i>  [sarcastically] </i> And modest.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Oh, believe me, she <i>  is </i> being modest.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : TGIF? You've heard of that?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yeah, it's some kind of acronym, but my inbox is full.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : We know that's not true.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : A student needs help identifying some remains, and there's a TV show that needs research. Not that they listen.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : We're going.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I really should catalog that skull. It's in the museum's exhibit on the French Revolution.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Yeah, Pepe le Pew is more important than booze and boys.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I don't think that's his name.</dd></dl>

I have three brothers and four sisters.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Do you enjoy that?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : God, no. I made the mistake of telling them I work with corpses and skeletons. They think I'm a freak.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Then why do you go?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : They're my family... They love me.</dd></dl>

I have to follow protocol.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Bureaucratic nonsense.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Fine, then. We're done here. You wanna get some coffee?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : My name is Dr. Temperance Brennan.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Reason for wanting a gun?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : To shoot people.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Not a good answer.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : It's the truth.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You know what? I'm putting, "Self defense in performance of my duties pursuing suspected felons as contracted out to the FBI."</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : So that I can shoot them.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Ever been charged with a felony?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Charged or convicted?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Charged.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You know I have.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Name of the arresting officer?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You.

Season 1
A Man on Death Row[1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I believe in the death penalty. There are certain people who shouldn't be in this world. The people who hacked hundreds of innocent children to death in Rwanda; beheaded them at their desks at school! The people who did that, they should be executed.</dd></dl>
Season 1
A Man on Death Row[1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Look at this guy. He's cuter than a monkey with a puppy.</dd></dl>
Season 1
A Man on Death Row[1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : There was doubt. We had an obligation to respect that doubt. We all share in the death of every human being.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Very poetic.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : No, very literal. We all share DNA. When I look at a bone, it's not some artifact that I can separate from myself. It's a part of a person who got here the same way I did. It should never be easy to take someone's life. I don't care who it is.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <hr width="50%" /></dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : Using a refrigerator to hide a body... kinda perfect, isn't it?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : A good way to remove the victim without being detected.

Season 1
The Man in the Fallout Shelter[1.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : It's all so tragic. A cheap wedding ring sewn into his suit. Two tickets to Paris. It makes you wonder, who was the girl?

<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : X-rays, pictures: we're going to do this without touching the actual skeleton as much as possible.</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : Kid gloves?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Latex should be all right... Zack, were you being metaphoric?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : I decided to give it a shot. Which is also metaphoric.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Woman at the Airport[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I can't go to Los Angeles. I have an Iron Age warrior to authenticate.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Iron Age warrior? When was the Iron Age?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Fifteen hundred years ago.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Fresh body bits; just a little more urgent.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You do realize there are a lot more fresh bodies than there are perfect specimens from the Iron Age?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You know, when you say things like that, it's just to bug me, right?</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Woman at the Airport[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Goodman </b> : His bones bear the marks of battle. His weapons are of good quality, well-used. He's old for a warrior. Yet how did he die, Mr. Addy?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : Looks like tuberculosis.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Goodman </b> : A proud man. Not the ending he would have wanted.

<dl><dd> <b>  Pickering </b> : What I need to do here is to establish that you are not a threat to the security of this country.</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : I'm getting a degree in Forensic Anthropology; I'm halfway through another in Engineering. What are you afraid I will do? Build a race of criminal robots that will destroy the earth?</dd><dd> <b>  Pickering </b> : Do you have that kind of fantasy often?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : Very often.</dd><dd> <b>  Pickering </b> : Does it concern you that such adolescent thoughts are a sign of emotional retardation?</dd><dd> <b>  Zack </b> : I've been told.

<dl><dd> <i>  [Booth and Brennan are looking through the room of a teenage murder victim.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Unbelievable. <i>  [sighs and goes over to pick up some comic books] </i> This is quite the collection of comic books.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Hodgins said that the cellulose mass was a graphic novel. He sent it to Angela for analysis and recovery.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Sweet.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Sweet?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Ah, he has Batman #127, featuring The Hammer of the Thor. This is worth about three hundred bucks.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Booth, are you a nerd?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : First of all, you mean geek. And no, I'm not, okay? It's quite normal for an American male to read comic books.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I find it hard to believe you have anything in common with Warren Granger.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Oh, you mean isolated, with an inner secret life? No, okay. I'd say you were more like Warren.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Superhero in the Alley[1.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Goodman </b> : All writers reveal more of themselves than they intend on their page.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You know, I've gotta tell you, I never bought all that English 101 stuff. Sometimes a river is just a river.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [to Goodman] </i> With all due respect, my writing, for example, is pure fiction.</dd><dd> <b>  Goodman </b> : Dr. Brennan, I fear you reveal much more of your worldview in your writing than you realize.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Such as?</dd><dd> <b>  Goodman </b> : Such as, archeologists make good administrators because they enjoy tedium.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Such as, artists are doomed to a life of loneliness because they are unable to think beyond instant gratification.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Such as, you know, FBI guys are hot and Angela here wants to have sex with me.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Superhero in the Alley[1.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You said before that Warren reminded you of me. You think I'm just like him, that he hid from life by immersing himself in a fantasy world where he fought crime. And I do the same thing, only I don't have superpowers. I... I have science.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : No, Bones. You do fight crime. It's not a fantasy. As far as any normal person is concerned, you do have superpowers.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You're just saying that to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : No, I don't do that.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yes, you do.

The Superhero in the Alley[1.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Well, in your book, your partner's a former Olympic boxer who graduated from Harvard and spoke six different languages.

The Woman in the Garden[1.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You put a hit out on my partner?</dd><dd> <b>  Ortez </b> : She's not FBI.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : <i>  [punches him in the face, grabs him and points his gun right at his throat] </i> I never said anything about the FBI. She's my partner, <i>  see. </i> And if anything happens to her, I will find you and I will kill you. I won't think twice.

Season 1
The Man in the Morgue[1.19]

They bury him in the desert. They throw 'em to wood chippers. Sometimes, you know, years go by. They relax. Then they start living their lives like they didn't do anything wrong. Like they didn't spend somebody else's life in order to get what they got. They think they're safe from retribution. You make those bastards unsafe. That's why I'm nice to you.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I couldn't do that without you, Booth.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yeah.

The Soldier in the Grave[1.21]
<dl><dd> <b>  Goodman </b> : It's difficult knowing Kent will never play again.

The Soldier in the Grave[1.21]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Yeah. Men aren't like us. They're much more fragile and needy. The fact that they think <i>  we're </i> the needy ones is a testament to our superiority.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yeah. I guess I forgot.</dd></dl>

You needed someone to blame and you chose me.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I was fifteen years old!</dd><dd> <b>  Russ Brennan </b> : I was nineteen. My parents were gone. My sister hated my guts.

You turned your back on me and you made yourself a new family.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [To a group of nine-year-olds] </i> So yours is a cultural structure predicated in the equation of beauty with power.

The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond[4.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Sweets, what are you doing?</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : I'm putting myself in the mind of an obsessive-compulsive in order to figure out where I might conceal a memory-enhancing, psychosexual proxy.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Right, right.

You know what I mean, Dr. Brennan.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : No, I do not.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Try me, Mr. Tushman.</dd><dd> <b>  Tushman </b> : Book writing is no longer about good writing <i>  per se. </i> It's about marketability. A book of the author. There's a reason why your photo takes up the entire back cover of your books.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Because I'm a very good writer.</dd><dd> <b>  Tushman </b> : You're serviceable, but your success is contingent upon your image as a hot scientist chick.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : That's not true, is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Of course not!

Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I don't want to be a writer any more.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Oh, why? Because of what that publisher said? He was an idiot. Did you see his glasses?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Well, I don't want to be a sexy scientist.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Well, that's like me saying I don't want to be a sexy FBI agent.

Season 4
The Crank in the Shaft[4.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : Well, uh, first I think it's important to find out what went wrong, why you were involved in an unsuccessful relationship.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Who said it was unsuccessful?</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : You're not together anymore, are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Do you love your parents?</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : But you don't live together anymore, does that mean your relationship with mom and dad was unsuccessful?</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : I don't think it's the same.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : I do.

<dl><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : Does Brennan put "Mr." before your name?</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : That's her very subtle way of saying you're not a doctor.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Mr. Nigel Murray </b> : Can I ask you something?</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : Is there any way to say no?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Nigel Murray </b> : What ever happened to whoever it was who used to work here before me?</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : He joined forces with a serial killer who was the last in the long line of cannibalistic murderers specializing in knocking off members of secret societies and building skeletons out of their body parts.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Nigel Murray </b> : Wow, I hope that doesn't happen to me.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The He in the She[4.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : <i>  [about the victim] </i> "He"?</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent </b> : Mmm-hmm. Triangular pubis, no evidence of a ventral arc. The pelvic bone speaks. It says, "I be male."</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : The pelvic bone can say whatever it wants to say. This part here <i>  [points in the general direction of the lower body] </i> says female.</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent </b> : What part's that?</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : It's called a vagina.</dd></dl>

You're going to jinx me.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan: </b> Well, if you're relying on superstition for safety, perhaps I should carry the gun.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Skull in the Sculpture[4.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [She walks up while Daisy and Cam are discussing the sculpture, and dumps a giant container of flesh-eating beetles onto it.

They'll strip the flesh off our victim in no time.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [nodding] </i> Within 30 hours.

They should not be doing that on the forensic platform.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : That's a method of termination I've never tried. Bravo, Dr. Sweets.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth: </b> They'll never work. They're, like, complete opposites.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan: </b> I agree. For all her faults, she's a woman of science. Sweets bases his life on the vagaries of psychology and emotion. There's no common ground.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth: </b> Right.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan: </b> You need common ground. What else is there?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth: </b> Absolutely.</dd><dd> <i>  [Booth and Brennan look at each other as Sweets and Daisy walk away together.] </i></dd></dl>

Season 4
The Con Man in the Meth Lab[4.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [to Booth's brother Jared] </i> It is nice to meet you, Jarhead. I can see the family resemblance. Your facial structure is even more symmetrical than Booth's.</dd><dd> <b>  Jared </b> : <i>  [to Booth, aside] </i> Is she coming on to me?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : No, it's just the way she talks.</dd></dl>

The Con Man in the Meth Lab[4.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [toasting Booth] </i> Anthropology teaches us that the alpha male is the man wearing the crown, displaying the most colorful plumage and the shiniest baubles. He stands out from the others. But I now think that anthropology may have it wrong. In working with Booth, I've come to realize that the quiet man, the invisible man, the man who's always there for friends and family... that's a real alpha male. And I promise my eyes will never be caught by those shiny baubles again.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Flight Attendant </b> : <i>  [having caught Booth in first class, reclining next to Brennan] </i> Sir, you need to return to coach.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : See, we're partners. We like being together.</dd><dd> <b>  Flight Attendant </b> : Your sexual relationship is not relevant, sir. This is first class.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Why does everyone always think we have a sexual relationship when we barely ever even touch each other?</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Passenger in the Oven[4.10]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Booth visits Brennan in the first-class section of the plane.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Are you tired of working with me?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : No, it's not that. But the identification and analysis of ancient remains, that's why I became a forensic anthropologist.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You're bored. The spark is gone.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I'm a scientist first.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Right. Yeah. A scientist first. I get it. I understand.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Hey, if you get caught up here, does that make me an accessory?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : <i>  [smiles] </i> An accessory to an upgrade.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Passenger in the Oven[4.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : <i>  [sees Brennan wearing cats-eye glasses while examining remains] </i> Bones. All right, what I want you to do is take off your glasses, shake out your hair and say, "Mr. Booth, do you know what the penalty is for an overdue book?"</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [looks confused] </i> Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Never mind.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Passenger in the Oven[4.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You want to get off the plane to see those old Chinese bones. I'm sorry.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : It's not your fault.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yes, it is. Because I'm the one who dragged you out of pure science and pulled you into murder-solving.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : That's not how I remember it.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Really?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yes. As I recall, I had to force you to take me into the field.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : <i>  [smiles] </i> Really?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yes.

Season 4
The Bone that Blew[4.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Your dad works here now?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Not my idea.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : She wants me to fire him.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : This is a crime lab!

Because I killed one man and we both know he deserved it?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : All right, just cut it out, Max, all right? I'll talk to her. Probably ain't gonna get anywhere with her, but I'll talk to her.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : You're a good man, and I want that for her. Now, I gotta go blow up some soda for some kids.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Bone that Blew[4.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> : I've decided I'm leaving the Jeffersonian.</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Because I fired him.</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : You can do that?</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : Oh, yeah. Believe me, she can do it.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Well, it's all about proximity to forensic evidence.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : Don't take any offense, but that's a lot of crap. It's about a proximity to me. Right?</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : Well, in my opinion, it isn't your father's presence that's causing you anxiety. It's the memory of his absence.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I can understand quantum mechanics, but I can't understand you.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Bone that Blew[4.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Don't fire Max. You know, let him keep his job. He's a teacher, not a janitor.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I can't overlook the sanctity of the forensic lab, Booth.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yeah. Maybe you can overlook it for me.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : For you?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yeah. Personal favor.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Like a partner thing?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : <i>  [smiles] </i> Partner thing.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [smiles] </i> I know you, Booth.

Fire in the Ice[4.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Hey, you know what? Forget about Agent Perotta. All right? Nothing is gonna change between me and you.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Well, entropy is a natural force that pulls everything apart in a subatomic level. Everything changes.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Not everything, Bones. <i>  [pushes Brennan around on the ice, and they laugh] </i> Not everything.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You're gonna make me fall!</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : I'm never gonna make you fall.

Season 4
The Hero in the Hold[4.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : You never told her [you loved her]?</dd><dd> <b>  Teddy </b> : I was twenty. It was hard.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : I. Love. You. It's three words, really not that hard.</dd><dd> <b>  Teddy </b> : What, you've never loved somebody and didn't say it to 'em? <i>  (Booth is silent) </i> See, maybe that's why I'm here: to get you to say "I love you" to somebody.</dd></dl>

Caribbean bean!</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You hurt your back again?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Nope. No, no, no. It's that obvious, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Your gait suggests you restrained your anterior longitudinal ligament.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yeah, well, I blame the couch, all right? I fell asleep last night watching the game. Look, I figured you fixed my back last time. Really, I just thought that maybe you could fix it again. So use your little magic knuckles and hit it up, and we're ready to go.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Booth, if this has become a recurring problem, you should see a specialist.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Right.

The Doctor In The Den[4.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : I'm thinking the victim wandered away from his car, he was drunk, and he ended up in this area. The same thing happened to a guy last year in the giraffe section.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Giraffes are herbivores. They don't eat people.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : That part is different, but the guy broke his arm. Did you know that giraffes can weigh up to two tons?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yes. Everyone knows that.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : And they sleep less than two hours a day.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : That I did not know.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yes!

Season 4
The Doctor In The Den[4.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Ooh, what is that smell? Are you wearing cologne?</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : It's urine. I found traces of uric acid on the victim's clothing.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Oh.</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : It was the pheromones you found pleasing.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Yeah, yeah. The pheromones in tiger urine?</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : Well, I assume it was tiger urine.

The Doctor In The Den[4.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : We're scientists. We can't quantify or rely on our emotions. They're arbitrary and indeterminate.</dd><dd> <b>  Saroyan </b> : We know people through our feelings, Dr. Brennan. You trust Booth because of how you feel.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : No, I trust Booth because of past actions.</dd><dd> <b>  Saroyan </b> : And faith in the future.

<dl><dd> <b>  Saroyan </b> : Anything of value yet?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : We're cataloging injuries. I thought you would be with Booth.</dd><dd> <b>  Saroyan </b> : Questioning people isn't really my thing. Most of the time I just want to beat them until they tell me what I want to hear.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I know, it gets frustrating, and hitting can quite often be effective.</dd><dd> <b>  Clark </b> : You both work with the Justice Department?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Clark </b> : Ironic.</dd></dl>

You do not have a chance at recreating those velocities with a glorified blow-gun. You simply want to fire a cannon at a dummy.</dd><dd> <b>  Hodgins </b> : <i>  [holds out safety goggles] </i> Are you staying or going?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Nigel-Murray </b> : Another set of eyes taking note can never be amiss.</dd></dl>

Okay, what about the sexual component in their relationship?

Those are the risks. That's the burden. Like wings, they have weight, we feel that weight on our backs, but they are a burden that lifts us. Burdens that allow us to fly.</dd></dl>

All riddles are solvable to you, except for one.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yes, the riddle of how you knew where your sister was buried.</dd><dd> <b>  Avalon </b> : No. The riddle you can't solve is how somebody could love you.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [laughs dismissively] </i> Well, I'm beautiful and very intelligent.</dd><dd> <b>  Avalon </b> : The answer to the question you're afraid to say out loud is: yes, he knows the truth about you, and he is dazzled by that truth.</dd></dl>

The Bond In The Boot[5.2]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : Perhaps he's a double agent. I mean, Rutledge certainly fits the profile. They're usually intelligent male officers, who had poor father figures resulting in repressed anger and revenge fantasies.</dd><dd> <b>  Harold Prescott </b> : Double agent?</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : By betraying his country Rutledge is essentially choosing a new father. One who might treat him better than the last.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Yes, but that would also fit Booth and he's not a double agent. Are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Stop.

He doesn't trust me? Oh, right. How could I forget about cook/client privilege.</dd><dd> <b>  Wyatt </b> : Chef/client privilege!</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : Has he also told you about how now when he climbs stairs he leads with his right foot rather than his left?

Assuming the accomplice was already lying in wait, surely he would have had the forethought to bring a more suitable weapon.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Like a gun.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Nigel-Murray </b> : Or a giant sword.

She sees the world one way, I see it another way.</dd><dd> <b>  Wyatt </b> : Of course! It's absolutely ludicrous, the idea of you together, but the heart chooses what it chooses, doesn't it? We don't really have a say in the matter.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : She doesn't love me. I would know if she loved me.</dd><dd> <b>  Wyatt </b> : May I counsel patience on this front.

My dad brought by my second cousin and I really didn't like her.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Well that makes sense.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Why do you say that?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Because she's family. Ninety percent of the time, family just gets under your skin.

<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Oh, good! You got here for the good stuff!</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : What good stuff?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : The MRI.

The X in the File[5.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : It's ridiculous to think that there's anything on this planet worth seeing which merits crossing what are literally astronomical distances.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Maybe aliens are anthropologists. Maybe they just want to study our religion, and sex, and love, and our funny languages and line dancing.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : That's an interesting possibility I hadn't considered.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Well they're living creatures.

I assume it's positive and you're worried about losing the most important person in this lab.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : No. Very modest. I'm asking because Michelle was here earlier this afternoon and the only other two people who you use that bathroom, beside me, are you and Angela.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Well, Angela is currently sexually active.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : Very true.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : With Wendell!</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : Very, very active!</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : And even if they use condoms, Wendell is young!

<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Bone graft. It looks like a repair to a screw hole.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : Huh. I count three metal plates.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Indicating multiple corrective surgeries.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : Which could help us positively identify these remains.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Mr. White told us to regard identification as a zero priority.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : I'm not as good as you are at doing as I'm told.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : <i>  [smiles] </i> Thank you!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Hey, guys!

He really believes this is the greatest country ever.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Being the best doesn't mean being perfect.</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : It's naive to think that a country the size and influence doesn't pursue secret agendas.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : Kennedy's assassination wasn't a secret agenda, it was a black stain. A dark moment in history. Do you know how many people Booth has shot for his country?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Approximately fifty.</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : Wow. That's a lot of blood to have on your hands. It's the kind of thing that would keep a person awake at night.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : And Booth did that because he trusted that it was right, and who did he trust?</dd><dd> <b>  Sweets </b> : The government.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Oh.</dd><dd> <b>  Cam </b> : If they lied about the murder of a president, they can lie about anything.</dd></dl>

I mean, sometimes you have to go with your brain over of your gut.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : That's nice, but I prefer that you always go with your brain over your gut, because your gut cannot think.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Your brain can't digest a breakfast burrito.

<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Four years ago Jared's girlfriend was a hooker?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : An escort.

I don't see any other injuries that could be cause of death. Apparently the rule is, once a sex worker always a sex worker.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : You know, it really would have been better if Booth never ran her record.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : He said it was my influence. That it was the rational thing to do.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : No, sweetie, he's rationalizing. Which makes what he did irrational, because he's rationalizing that Jared can't make rational decisions for himself. You do the same thing all the time. Maybe that's what he learned from you.</dd></dl>

Season 5
The Dentist in the Ditch[5.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : When Booth and I first met, I didn't believe that such a thing as love existed. I maintained that it was simply brain chemistry, but perhaps Booth is correct. Perhaps love comes first and creates the reaction. I have no tangible proof, but I'm willing to accept Booth's premise.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Right now I'm worried about a safe distance between you and me.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Why? Because we're going to a church, and you tend to get blasphemous in churches.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You're afraid if God smites me with lightning you could get hit?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yeah, I'm usually standing right beside you.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : The Greek god Zeus also used lightning to incinerate his enemies, although Zeus apparently had better aim than your god.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Exactly. Stuff like that. Just don't say stuff like that.</dd></dl>

The Devil in the Details[5.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : You have faith that you will retain your faith? Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Because, Bones.

I put sugar in my coffee and it tastes sweet. The sun comes up because the world turns. These things are beautiful to me. There are mysteries I will never understand, but everywhere I look I see proof that for every effect there is a corresponding cause. Even if I can't see it. I find that reassuring.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : And life is good again.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : It is very good.</dd><dd> <b>  Booth </b> : Yes, it is.</dd></dl>

The Devil in the Details[5.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Copeland </b> : I've listened to you take shots at my profession, and that's okay. I'm a big boy, a tolerant man, but I want you to think about something. I spend every working hour of every day trying to help people who are living in Hell. That's an honorable way to spend a life. Perhaps more honorable than figuring out what happened to dead people who are already beyond pain and suffering.</dd><dd> <b>  Bones </b> : Intentions, however misguided, do count. I understand that.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Copeland </b> : I hope you won't think I'm too picky when I point out that that wasn't an actual apology. But perhaps it's the best you can manage.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : I believe my books are popular because they introduce the reader to the world of forensic anthropology. Why aren't you writing? You usually write down everything.</dd><dd> <b>  Riku Inagawa </b> : Why did it take so long for Dr. Reichs to have sex with Agent Andy?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : For the same reason that she used stable isotopes to determine that the victim spent her childhood in east Timur. The oxygen isotopes we ingest through food and water are incorporated into the hydroxocarbonic appetite of bone. You should be writing this down.</dd><dd> <b>  Inagawa </b> : Will she ever tell Andy about her affair with Ryan?</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : That was inconsequential fluff, Miss Inagawa.</dd><dd> <b>  Inagawa </b> : It's why they fight in chapter six.</dd><dd> <b>  Brennan </b> : They identify the lotus tooth in chapter six.</dd><dd> <b>  Inagawa </b> : That is when their passion is released.
