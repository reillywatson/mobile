Season 2
Death Defying (2.10)
<dl><dd> <b>  Ray Summers </b> : George, there are 5 reasons why men are scum and women let us get away with it. 1. We all only want one thing. No exceptions. 2. We fall in love before we get that one thing, and fall out of love after we get it. Conversely, women fall in love after. 3. We will lie, cheat, steal or murder to get that one thing. Why am I sugarcoating this? You're a big girl. To fuck you. 4. We freely admit 1 through 3 and women don't care, and the number 5 reason why men are scum and women don't care: You can't live without us.</dd></dl>
