Chuck Versus the Breakup[2.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Chuck </b> : Look, we both know how I feel about you so I'm just going to shoot straight. You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. You're smart, beautiful, you laugh at all my stupid jokes and have a horrible habit of always saving my life. The truth is, you're everything that I thought I ever wanted and more. And the last few days all I could think about is our future together. About what it's going to be like once I get the Intersect out of my head and we can be together for real, no fake relationship, no covers, no lies. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that you and I can never have a future together. I fooled myself into thinking that we could but the truth is we can't. Because even if we had a real relationship it'd never really be real. I still won't know anything about you, your real name, your home town, your first love, anything. And I want more than that. I want to be able to call you at the end of a bad day and tell you about some funny thing Morgan did but I can't cause you'll be somewhere in Paraguay quelling a revolution with a fork. I'm a normal guy who wants a normal life. And as amazing as you are, Sarah Walker, we both know that you will never be normal.</dd></dl>
