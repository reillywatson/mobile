Season 2
Z is for Zenith
<dl><dd> <b>  Will </b> : It was over. Took everyone and everything we had. Teamwork. Harmony. Yeah, that's how we maxed out our power. Anyway, we won! We all made tracks and the Regents abandoned the glamour. The destruction down town was blamed on the snowstorm, which made no sense, but people believe what they like to believe. Case and point; Nerissa. She would remain with Julian. And, maybe in time father and son would make peace with what she had done. Meanwhile the other baddies where back where they belonged. And so was a fully powered Elyon on Meridian's throne, surrounded by people she can trust, including Raythor, who finally has a monarch worthy of his service. It was kind off a new start for everyone. The Council of Kandrakar was back in business. Queen Kadma returned her heart to Zamballa, but abdigated her throne for a more, <i>  humble </i> life on Earth. And a ghost-free Cassidy went home too. Yan Lin introduced her family to her long lost twin sister Mira, while the rest of us just tried to find our way back to normal.It pretty much took all winter break. But by the time school started I think we had finally decompressed.</dd></dl>
