Opening narration
<dl><dd> <b>  J.T. Marsh  (VO) </b> : It was a golden age for all mankind. Using the incredible exoskeletons called E-frames , we had successfully terraformed Venus and Mars , and were now poised to move on to the Outer Planets . Suddenly, it all ended. We were pressed into a nightmarish war on a scale previously unimagined. We were attacked by our own creations, the Neosapiens , a race of artificially created humans. Led by Phaeton , they had seized control of Venus, Earth , and Mars. This is Lt. J.T. Marsh, member of the Exofleet , leader of a small band of E-frame pilots dedicated to freeing humanity from Neosapien rule. We are... the Exosquad .</dd></dl>
