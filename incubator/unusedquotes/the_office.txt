The Quiz[1.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  David </b> : There are limits to my comedy. There are things that I'll never laugh at. The handicapped. Because there's nothing funny about them. Or any deformity. It's like when you see someone look at a little handicapped and go "Ooh, look at him, he's not able-bodied. I am, I'm prejudiced." Yeah, well, at least the little handicapped fella is able-minded. Unless he's not, it's difficult to tell with the wheelchair ones. Just give generously to them all.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : I always wanted to be a children's illustrator and when people said, "What do you do?"

Then Lee thought it would be a good idea for us both to get full-time jobs and then you're knackered after work and it's hard to do illustrating. So now, when people ask me what I do, I say I'm a receptionist.</dd></dl>

Episode 2.04[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  David </b> : The reason I put " <i>  If </i> it's in you" is, if I waste good time and money looking for it, and see it's definitely not in you, I don't wanna be sued 'cos you haven't got it, so, you know, you're not gonna get me on that.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Episode 2.04[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Simon </b> : You know Bruce Lee's not really dead, don't you? Yeah, it's in a book.

<dl><dd> <b>  David </b> : I don't look upon this like it's the end, I look upon it like it's moving on you know. It's almost like my work here's done. I can't imagine Jesus going, "Oh, I've told a few people in Bethlehem I'm the son of God, can I just stay here with Mum and Dad now?" No. You gotta move on. You gotta spread the word. You gotta go to Nazareth, please. And that's, very much like... me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Episode 2.06[2.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  David </b> : Life is just a series of peaks and troughs. And you don't know whether you're in a trough until you're climbing out, or on a peak until you're coming down. And that's it you know, you never know what's round the corner. But it's all good. "If you want the rainbow, you've gotta put up with the rain." Do you know which "philosopher" said that? Dolly Parton . And people say she's just a big pair of tits.</dd></dl>
