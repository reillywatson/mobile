That's what I would do. Hey, look I know you have morals and scruples and that's fine, sort of. But you are not the man I on occasion pretend to respect if you don't get this under control. Hey, you have a soft spot for the mortals. A charming fascination with all of the things they do while listening to the tick-tick-tick of their own looming demise. That's fine that's good, everyone needs a hobby.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Arrested Development [1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : [narrating] Maybe it's the sum of a million coincidences we don't quite control that brings us to a particular place at a particular time. [he drops his keys, they roll under his car. He bends down to get them.]</dd><dd> <b>  Beth </b> : [can't see Mick, walks beside his car]</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : [narrating] Or maybe it's the choices we make, the actions we take. If there's one thing I've learned in 85 years, it's that what we want doesn't always matter. [He stands with his keys, coming face to face with Beth. They both gasp]</dd><dd> <b>  Beth </b> : You just took off.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Well, you were kinda tied up with your editor.</dd><dd> <b>  Beth </b> : You could at least have said goodbye.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Good- [Beth stands on her toes to kiss him] bye.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : [They kiss again] [narrating] What we want, doesn't always matter... but then again, sometimes it's the only thing that does.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Fated to Pretend [1.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : [narrating] If there's one thing I've learned in 85 years, it's that what you want, doesn't really matter. You can want to get from here to there, you can want to be on time. You can want to avoid someone, 'cause, say you drank their blood out in the desert. You can want all of these things, but if the universe wants something different, you can run, but you can't hide.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Beth </b> : Did you know my editor was investigating your involvement in a bogus charity scheme?</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : Nice to see you, Beth, me I'm doin' great, thanks. Except for the drywall dust. It gets everywhere.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Beth's editor was killed a few hours ago.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : I'm sorry. So. Am I a suspect? [they nod] Cool! It's like roleplaying, but without the leather.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Your name came up in connection with a story Maureen was working on.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : Was her body found in the La Brea Tar Pits?</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : That was the only person I killed this week.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Josef, this is serious.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : No, this is stupid. Look I'm on the board of dozens of charities. I had no idea that this one was bogus until Maureen told me.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Ok, we'll talk to your PR man.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : Remember the Tar Pits?</dd></dl>

I said, no, wait. That can't possibly be the Mick that I know.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : You should come, you'd enjoy it.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : No, you see, I'm a lover, not a fighter. Besides I'd only get myself dead trying to protect you. The Human Liability.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : I can take care of myself.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : [snarls, attacks, pinning Mick against the wall] Is this how you want it to end!?!</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Get off me!</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : I hope I've made my point.</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Yeah. You did. I can't save Beth as a human. You're gonna have to change me back.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : Mick, no. After all you did to find the cure, you're gonna give it up this easy?</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : You think this is easy? This is not easy, okay, I don't have a choice.</dd><dd> <b>  Josef </b> : What you're asking me to do...</dd><dd> <b>  Mick </b> : Listen to me! He's got Beth.... he's got my Beth.
