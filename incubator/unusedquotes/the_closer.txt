Standards and Practices[1.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brenda </b> : <i>  [To PHD team] </i> I just want to say that there's been a complaint lodged against me - an anonymous complaint with Internal Affairs and there's a meeting about it tomorrow, and I don't know what's going to happen. Interrogating people, getting to the truth and knowing the right thing to do politically are two very different things. In fact, to do either of them very well, you have to pretty much ignore one of them altogether, which is what I've done. So now...I'm in trouble again, and I don't know if I'll even be here tomorrow evening, and if I'm not, I just wanted to tell you all how much I've enjoyed working with you. Y'all are just, just really great people.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Provenza </b> : Ok. We all know what's going on here. The smart move is to not get involved until the dust settles.</dd><dd> <b>  Flynn </b> : Yeah. That's the smart move, alright. What's your idea?</dd></dl>

Standards and Practices[1.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Brenda </b> : I'd like to start with you, Ms. Powell. I'd like to say how sorry I am that I was unable to ignore your general level of incompetence in the wrongly obtained conviction in the case of Bill Croelick. And I'm sorry if you felt hurt and defensive about putting a man on death row for the wrong crime, and I certainly hope that that will never, ever happen again. Agent Jackson, I deeply regret that the FBI handed over two million dollars to a man on a terrorist watch list without the capacity to trace it, or managed to follow him for months without knowing his wife was having an affair with a doctor, and I hope you do much better in the future. Captain Taylor, I suppose I should apologize to you for not having been born in Los Angeles, but having seen you work up close now for several months, I can honestly say that try as I might, I can't think of any fair and reasonable system on earth where I wouldn't outrank you. There. I hope that clears everything up.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Dennis </b> : Hey, whoa. Why don't you people just wait in the living room?</dd><dd> <b>  Gabriel </b> : Hey, first of all we're not "you people", we're Los Angeles police, and when we show up unexpectedly, it's not because we have a problem, it's because you do. Now I suggest you step aside and be quiet.</dd></dl>
