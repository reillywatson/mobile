<dl><dd> <b>  Kyle </b> : <i>  (After the prom) </i> There's a reason why people say we shouldn't expect too much,no one wants to see someone they care about end up disappointed.We instinctively act to protect our own from being hurt, and do what we can to make the right choices for people we love.But the reason we have expectations in the first place, is because we want to aim as high as we can. Because when you love someone, there's no limit to what you can accomplish. <br /> <br /> <br /></dd></dl>
