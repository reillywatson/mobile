Season 1
Dexter
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami. It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World: Dahmerland!</dd></dl>

Season 1
Crocodile
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Lately the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her. But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong. That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Crocodile
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : We have an elephant in the room, and its name is sex.</dd><dd> <b>  Rita </b> : <i>  [laughs weakly] </i> Tell me about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Hey, as far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.</dd><dd> <b>  Rita </b> : <i>  [softly] </i> Easier said than done.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Yeah, <i>  [gently brushes her hair back] </i> but it needs to be right, for both of us.

Crocodile
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces. He came back and left nothing behind but a message: come find me, and I will. There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Popping Cherry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people. It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable. Not because I'm a killer. Really, I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake. In those cases, shades come in handy.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Popping Cherry
<dl><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. How are you holding up?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I'm managing. <i>  [voiceover] </i> No, I'm not. Keeping my face pinched in sorrow for two hours is a real chore.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Popping Cherry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Harry taught me that death isn't the end. It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful. He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside. But we must maintain appearances to survive. But there was something Harry didn't teach me. Something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know. The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity. It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.</dd></dl>

That Night, a Forest Grew
<dl><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : You finally decided to fight back. I've been waiting.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I hope you don't expect me to comment on that so you can record it on your hidden tape recorder. I wasn't born yesterday.</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : You might have been, for hell I know. Your past is a bigger mystery than fucking Jimmy Hoffa. I tried every avenue, legal and otherwise, but there ain't no paper trail on the early years of Dexter Morgan.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I guess there's no recorder running after all.</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : No, man. Unlike you, I do everything out in the open.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Well, in that case, sergeant, let me put this in the open for you.

Season 2
Morning Comes
<dl><dd> <b>  Lundy </b> : So you, one of the most cautious and precise forensic specialists I've had the pleasure to work with, you performed blood work that directly led to Rodrigo walking free. I ask myself, how the hell did that happen?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> And did you answer, Dexter blew the case on purpose so that he could get Rodrigo off the streets for good with a cordless reciprocating saw?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Morning Comes
<dl><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : So he's 20 years older than me, what do you care?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I don't. <i>  [pause] </i> I mean, <i>  [sits down, leans close] </i> I'm sure you wouldn't do anything like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : What are you talking about, do anything like what?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Like, try to sleep your way to the top.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : You <i>  douche </i> ! That is <i>  so </i> not true!</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Of course not, I shouldn't have even said anything, and I'm sure that thought would <i>  never </i> even occur to anybody else.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Double-douche! You are not allowed to talk about anyone I date as long as you're seeing Little Miss "Pardon My Tits". I'm sorry, Dex, but she is <i>  gross </i> . And <i>  pale </i> , and nobody is pale in Miami. She is obviously a vampire. A gross, English, titty vampire.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : You just described the perfect woman.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : <i>  [disgusted] </i></dd></dl>

Season 2
Resistance Is Futile
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [on Lila] </i> She had me fighting with myself the whole time. All that self-reflection is unhealthy.</dd></dl>

Give it up.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Would you, in my position?</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : I wouldn't be in your position, you sick fuck.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : You sure about that?

Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Why couldn't you just leave me to do my work in peace? Why'd you have to go and ruin everything?</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : You're a killer. I catch killers.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : So do I. I caught you.</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : I'm not a killer.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [chuckles] </i> You are. That's why you've always known what I am. That's why you have more officer-related shootings than anybody else. Only I don't fuck with you when you shoot somebody. Why couldn't you pay me the same professional courtesy?</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : There's nothing professional about what you do. I kill when I have to, on the job.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Oh, so it's okay to take a life as long as you get a paycheck for it?</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : My code requires a higher standard of proof than your city's laws, at zero cost to the taxpayer. If you ask me, I'm a bargain.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Lundy </b> : I thought we were out as a couple.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Out and flaunting it are two different things.</dd><dd> <b>  Lundy </b> : What, don't ask, don't tell?</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Works for the military.</dd><dd> <b>  Lundy </b> : Not really.</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Taking a life is one thing, but the care and feeding of it is another. I can't keep my problem locked away in a cabin forever. Harry always said there were plenty of people who deserve to die. But no matter how hard I close my eyes and wish, Doakes isn't one of them.</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I remember when life was easy. When the only question I worried about was who's next. Now it's: How can I dodge my "protective detail"? What should I do with my "hostage"? These are not easy questions.</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Vince Masuka </b> : All those times he called me lab geek, fairywinkle, donkey fluffer. I'm just glad I took it lying down, you know?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : What the fuck, Dex?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : What which fuck?</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Deb, Doakes is a lot of things, but he's not an idiot. He won't come out of the shadows because of a grudge.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Right. 'Cause serial killers are so practical.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Actually, they are.</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Doakes said I had two choices: kill him or let him go. But he neglected to look behind Door Number 3. Hand him over to the FBI, gift-wrapped. I don't need Doakes dead, I just need his fingerprints to complete my framejob.</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> When the Feds receive these kill tools with their suspect's prints on them, the only threat to me will be the inane rants of a murderous madman.

Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I'm sure Special Ops taught you to rattle your captor, but I should warn you, Sergeant. You can't play on my feelings. I don't have any.</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : Oh, really. Who's lying now?</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : You're not gonna do what I think you are.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : There's no point in hiding it now, Sergeant. Your life is going to rest in the hands of the criminal justice system you put all your faith in. I wish you the best of luck.</dd></dl>
Season 2
There's Something About Harry
<dl><dd> <i>  [Dexter prepares to dismember his latest victim.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : Morgan, God damn it, you got a conscience, man, you said it yourself! You go after killers, you take out killers, I get that. But this, this is some sick fuck ritual, man, you need help. Let me help you, man.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Don't worry, Sergeant. I won't make you watch. I'm not uncivilized.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Left Turn Ahead
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I always thought hardening arteries squeezed the life out of my father. But it was me. Harry gazed into the eyes of his creation and saw evil, pure and simple. My evil. It killed him.</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : That shit about your father. You wanna talk about it?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : About what? That my life is one tragic mistake?</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : We've all felt that at one time or another. I know I have.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Did you happen to be stuffing a human leg into a garbage bag at that point?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Left Turn Ahead
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Harry's heart gave out when he saw what's inside me. He thought he could tame it, give it a purpose, help it find a place in the natural order. Guess he was wrong.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Left Turn Ahead
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I'm the helpful handyman. How evil can I possibly be?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Left Turn Ahead
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : In the long run it would be easier on Deb. Rita. Better than watching me dragged in like an animal. Which, let's face it, will happen. Some day.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Left Turn Ahead
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : If I do this, I need a day to get my affairs in order.</dd><dd> <b>  Doakes </b> : That's fine. Tie me up, throw me in the trunk, come on, let's go.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Left Turn Ahead
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I really enjoyed our conversations, James. I lie to everyone I know. Except my victims, right before I kill them. It's hard to establish much of a rapport there. Sorry about the cage.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The British Invasion
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Sleep, what a concept. I can't believe I actually contemplated turning myself in. This is so much better than a prison cell. I can squeeze fresh orange juice, savor a fine French roast, grab a morning workout. Okay, working out I could have done in prison. But still, I'm free.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The British Invasion
<dl><dd> <b>  Lila </b> : What do you think I wanted?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : To know what it's like. To feel something that deeply. Anything. That's why you hang out in recovery groups. You're emotionally colorblind. You use the right words, you pantomime the right behavior, but the feelings never come to pass.</dd><dd> <b>  Lila </b> : It's not true.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : It is, Lila. You know the dictionary definition of emotions. Longing, joy, sorrow. But you have no idea what any of those things actually feel like.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The British Invasion
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> It's strange to have a creation out there. A deeply mutated version of yourself, running loose and screwing everything up. I wonder if this is how parents feel.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The British Invasion
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Not long ago I had a dream that people could see me for what I am. And for a brief instant in time, the world actually saw my bodies of work. Some even cheered. But as it turns out, nobody mourns the wicked. Sorry, James.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The British Invasion
<dl><dd> I think Harry knew that from the start. That's why he gave me a code. It cost him his life, but it kept me alive through incredible trials. The code is mine now, and mine alone. So too are the relationships I cultivate.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The British Invasion
<dl><dd> They're not just disguises anymore. I need them. Even if they make me vulnerable. My father might not approve, but I'm no longer his disciple. I'm a master now. An idea transcended into life.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The British Invasion
<dl><dd> And so this is my new path. Which is a lot like the old one, only mine. To stay on that path I need to work harder, explore new rituals, evolve. Am I evil? Am I good? I'm done asking those questions. I don't have the answers. Does anyone?</dd></dl>

Finding Freebo
<dl><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Just like every other tweaker-hooker case.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Except the tattoo peeled off her shoulder.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Coroner says not a tattoo. <i>  [waves folder back and forth like a pendulum] </i> You're getting interested.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Actually, I'm getting sleepy.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Finding Freebo
<dl><dd> <b>  Vince Masuka </b> : Need all the luck I can get. Got a crucifix up there, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Because it did so much for Jesus?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Finding Freebo
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : You seem uncertain. It's uncomfortable, isn't it? Just when you think you've answered all the questions, another one smacks you in the face. Life, life, life. Life is just like that. Which is why I prefer death. <i>  [stabs Freebo in the neck] </i></dd></dl>
Season 3
The Lion Sleeps Tonight
<dl><dd> <i>  [Drinking coffee] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Quinn </b> : Sugar is so much better than the artificial stuff, don't you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I guess.</dd><dd> <b>  Quinn </b> : Do you like milk or cream?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Neither.</dd><dd> <b>  Quinn </b> : Not exactly the chatty type, are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : No.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Lion Sleeps Tonight
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Rita's pregnant.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Say again?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Rita's pregnant.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : You're lying.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I'm not lying.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : A baby? A mother-fucking rolly-polly chubby-cheeked shit machine, are you kidding me?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I've never heard it described in quite those words before, but yeah.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Lion Sleeps Tonight
<dl><dd> <b>  Sylvia Prado </b> : Men are such babies. They need to be carried kicking and screaming into fatherhood.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Lion Sleeps Tonight
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [getting medically scanned, voiceover] </i> It seems ironic that I, an expert on human dismemberment, have to pay 800 dollars to have myself virtually dissected.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Lion Sleeps Tonight
<dl><dd> <i>  [At yoga with Rita] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Yoga Instructor </b> : We are all strong warriors, all of us.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> This is absolutely, without a doubt, the worst moment of my life.</dd><dd> <b>  Yoga Instructor </b> : Now, let's go into a little free-form yoga. Just let yourself dance.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I was wrong. This is.</dd><dd> <b>  Yoga Instructor </b> : See the dust dancing against the sunlight. Be as beautiful as the golden flakes of dust, Dexter.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I could probably kill her before anyone realized what happened.</dd></dl>

All in the Family
<dl><dd> <b>  Vince Masuka </b> : Hell must have froze over, because cops won't eat doughnuts anymore.</dd></dl>
Season 3
All in the Family
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : Studies show that emotional intelligence plays a greater role in individual success than anything that can be measured on the standard IQ test.</dd><dd> <b>  Debra </b> : Are you calling me an emotional idiot?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : If you're an idiot, then I'm a vegetable.</dd></dl>
Season 3
All in the Family
<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover, about Ramon Prado] </i> You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. Unless you order his favorite and keep him waiting. And waiting.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> But if you play a role long enough, really commit, does it become real? Could I become real?</dd></dl>

You're cheating on her and you don't even realize it.</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : I'll make time for my Dark Passenger and for Rita.</dd><dd> <b>  Harry Morgan </b> : It's about priorities, Dexter. You're going to have to choose which one is your mistress and which one is your wife, and more importantly, which one comes first.</dd></dl>

Season 3
Easy As Pie
<dl><dd> <b>  Miguel </b> : So, uh, Ellen Wolf, a piece of work, right?</dd><dd> <b>  Dexter </b> : <i>  [thoughs] </i> Go easy, be tactful. <i>  [speech] </i> We can't kill her.</dd></dl>
