Bodies kept stacking up and I started to feel that it was because of me because I couldn't do my job, because I wasn't smart enough. Never did catch him, but I did lose it.

Let's pretend I was the one who caught Shales. I don't think I could've just handed that psychopath over to the court. Not after he'd eluded me for so long. Made me look bad.</dd><dd> <b>  Agent Mahone </b> : You been out in the sun way too long, boy.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : You feds make a nice living. But not so nice you go around tearing up expensive sod. Not unless you had to do a little digging. Not unless you had to hide something. Or someone. That's what all the lye was about, wasn't it? See because there are two kinds of lye. In small amounts the first one can be a gardener's best friend.

I'd think... I'd think maybe I should move that body. But then I'd remember that DNA leaches into soil. So even when the body was gone the proof of what I'd done would still be there. I can imagine how it feels. The pressure. The constant fear. Its more than a man can bear. I'm giving you a chance. Back off. Let me and my family disappear. And in return, I'll keep your little secret. How does that sound?</dd><dd> <b>  Agent Mahone </b> : Like a dead man talking.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : I know its not how you wanted us to play out. But sometimes things happen that are just... out of your control. This is one of those times.

Those orders were given by Caroline Reynolds who was Vice President at the time. Acting on those orders, I planted evidence, I procured a body, I lured Lincoln Burrows into that parking garage that evening under the auspices of a different hit. Ground up, we framed him. See, Lincoln Burrows get executed, people forget about Terrence Steadman, the controversy surrounding him and the Presidency, and nobody ever knows about The Company.</dd><dd> <b>  Woman Lawyer </b> : Yes, which is a shadowy cabal of corporations that pretty much influence everything that happens in this country. But I fail to see how any of this is relevant to Sara Tancredi and the fact that she aided and abetted, that she jumped bail--</dd><dd> <b>  Paul </b> : She did so because she feared for her life, which was appropriate, as I had orders to kill her.</dd></dl>
