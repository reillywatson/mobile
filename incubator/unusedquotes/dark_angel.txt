<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> <i>  [voiceover] </i> : The escape was not my idea. I mean, escape to what? We didn't know anything else. It was Zack who said we had to leave. So, I guess he saved my life. I didn't think we should separate. But he wouldn't listen. And I never even got a chance to thank him.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Pilot (1.01)
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> <i>  [voiceover] </i> : They used to say one nuclear bomb can ruin your whole day. It was sort of a joke, until the June morning those terrorist bozos whacked us with an electromagnetic pulse from 80 miles up. You always hear people yapping on how it was all different before the pulse. Land of milk and honey blah, blah, blah, blah with plenty of food and jobs and things actually worked. I was too young to remember, so, whatever... The thing I don't get is why they call it a depression. I mean, everybody's broke, but they aren't really all that depressed. Life goes on.</dd></dl>

I feel like I got hit by a cement truck and you've been up for an hour bouncing around. That, by definition, sucks.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : I made you coffee.

Season 1
Pilot (1.01)
<dl><dd> <b>  Logan </b> : Look around at all this. Built by people who got up every morning, worked hard trying to make a better life. Then the pulse happened and everyone got scared. They blinked and before they knew it they turned over the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands. Overnight, the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : So you miss the good old days. Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't need to, and rich people who still spent obscene amounts of money redecorating the house to match the cat. Those good old days?</dd><dd> <b>  Logan </b> : Even if they took it for granted, they still had a choice. Now they don't.</dd></dl>

So... what, you liked it 'cause it was shiny?</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast, the goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, destroyer, giver of life who lives forever.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Logan </b> : Look, maybe we got screwed out of living in a time when we could hang out for the afternoon in a cafe someplace wearing $2,000 wristwatches, planning our next vacation, but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden. It wasn't supposed to, but it did. So now it's back to the law of the jungle, and there are predators and victims.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Pilot (1.01)
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> <i>  [voiceover] </i> : Sometimes it seems like it happened to someone else. Like maybe it was a story I heard. The hardest part is not knowing if any of them made it. But if I knew for sure I was the only one left it would be worse. At least now I can make up lives for them... The truth is, they'd just be like me, living on the run, always looking over my shoulder. Hope is for losers. It's a con job people trip behind till they finally get a grip on the cold, hard truth. Still, I hope that they're out there somewhere and that they're okay.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Heat (1.02)
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> [ <i>  voiceover </i> ]: Kendra was right. I am in heat, or something like that... all because they spiced up that genetic cocktail called "me" with a dash of feline DNA, so I can jump 15 feet of razor wire and take out a 250-pound linebacker with my thumb and index finger, which makes me an awesome killing machine and a hoot at parties. But it also means that three times a year I'm climbing the walls, looking for some action. Thank God, the worst of it is over. If I can just get through the next 12 hours without doing something I'm going to regret.</dd></dl>

Problemo is, I'm not as like them as I'd like to be. I got made, not born, and because it was humans made me, somewhere along the line couple of wires got crossed in my head. Someone botched the job. So some days, that's how I feel - a botched job.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> [ <i>  voiceover </i> ]: At Manticore, Lydecker used to tell us the same thing: "There are no limits. What the mind can conceive, the body can achieve... With the right training." Only we could still get shot and killed like Eva... starve to death... or drown. I've often wondered why we didn't just turn on him. We were stronger, faster.
