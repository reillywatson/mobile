I saw him save the day dozens of times with nothing but his wits, body and will. But I saw something else as the years passed - he was getting older. Slower. Soon he'd have to retire, or more likely someone would finally manage to kill him. The thought of a world without Batman was unacceptable. So, I decided to make a new one. I used my old Cadmus connections to gather the technology necessary for Project: Batman Beyond. Bruce's DNA was easy enough to obtain. He left it all over town. <i>  [Terry gives her a look] </i> Not REMOTELY what I meant. <i>  [Cut to a shot of Batman being bandaged by a paramedic] </i> Then I found a young Neo-Gotham couple, with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce's parents. Your father thought he was getting a flu shot; actually it was a nanotech solution programmed to rewrite his reproductive material into an exact copy of Bruce Wayne's. A little over a year later, your mother gave birth to you, a child sharing half her genetic material... and half Bruce's.</dd></dl>

Epilogue
<dl><dd> <b>  Amanda Waller </b> : I've known Bruce Wayne for over fifty years, and I've been keeping an eye on you your whole life. You're not Bruce's <i>  clone </i> , you're his <i>  son </i> . There are similarities, mind you, but more than a few differences too. You don't quite have his magnificent brain, for instance; you do have his heart though, and for all that fierce exterior I've never met anyone who cared as deeply about his fellow man as Bruce Wayne, except maybe you.</dd></dl>
