I went a couple of times. With my uncle. New Hampshire.</dd><dd> <b>  Peggy Olsen </b> : I saw my cousin shoot a rabbit by Coney Island.</dd><dd> <b>  Pete Campbell </b> : It's an incredible sensation. You have to be very quiet. Take it down with the first shot or you scare it away. Then sometimes you have to go up and finish it off. Then you tie it to the bumper and go home. But do you know what I've always wanted to do? I would pick it up, throw its back legs over my shoulder, and I would drag it through the snow to this little cabin. And there, I'd hang it up between a couple of trees, cut it open, and drain it, dress it. Then I'd take my big hunting knife and I'd cut this loin right out the side. And I'd go into the cabin and there'd be this woman waiting for me. Standing by one of those old stoves with a big black pipe. And I'd hand it to her and she'd put it in a cast iron skillet and then I'd sit at the table. And she'd bring it to me. And I'd wipe my knife on my knee. And then I would eat it. While she watches.</dd><dd> <b>  Peggy Olsen </b> :That would be wonderful.</dd></dl>
