Everyone, let's try to help Butt-head, OK?</dd><dd> <b>  Butt-head </b> : Hey Beavis, check it out!</dd><dd> <b>  Ms. Jenkins </b> : Settle down please, all right boys? OK. What I'd like everyone to do is to repeat these sentences while watching your mouth in your mirrors, OK? All right, here goes: Speaking slowly as such can say just as much.</dd><dd> <b>  Butt-head </b> : Whoa, she just said "ass munch"!</dd><dd> <b>  Beavis </b> : Yeah, this chick rules.

Now I don't want you to take this to the wrong way, principal. But I've noticed that you have a litle trouble expressing yourself sometimes.</dd><dd> <b>  Principal McVicker </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Butt-head </b> : McVicker is a dumbass.
