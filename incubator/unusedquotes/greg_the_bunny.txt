<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : The philosopher Wittgenstein once wrote that, since it is through language that we think, it is language that limits us. And while the Puppish language may have 16 words for "furry," it apparently has no word for "Jimmy." If you ask me, that just blows.</dd></dl>

Greg Gets Puppish [1.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : So much of life comes down to choosing sides. Growing up, Jimmy and I were always on the same side. Mostly because no side ever wanted either one of us.

<dl><dd> <b>  Warren </b> : And, uh, you know, I wrote a bunch of jokes, but, uh, I'm not, uh... well, the thing is, I, uh, I wasn't there when Rochie died, and I hadn't seen that tape before. And, frankly, it, uh, moved me. I can think of nothing more beautiful than to depart this earth doing what it is that you love. And, in Rochester's case, performing, dancing under those bright lights, a hoofing cowboy dying with his boots on. So I salute you, Rochester, my rival, my friend, for going out in a grand, theatrical style. And I tip my hat to Greg.

<dl><dd> <b>  Gil </b> : But, you know, uh, Rochie was a, uh, bit of a health nut. He always stuck to a balanced diet. A drink in each hand.</dd><dd> <i>  [cricket chirping] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Gil </b> : 'Cause the diet was... balanced. Okay, I put together a little video tribute.

<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : Oh, this doesn't seem like a very respectful funeral. Look what they've done to Rochester.</dd><dd> <b>  Jimmy </b> : Well, Greg, when some people die, it's a time to be sad.

<dl><dd> <b>  Gil </b> : Hey, Warren, you shouldn't kick Rochie when he's down.</dd><dd> <b>  Warren </b> : Oh, right, right. Like when you fired him from his job of 15 years, and tossed him out onto the street. You replaced him with Greg, and you hired him back to be our manservant.</dd><dd> <b>  Gil </b> : Uh, no.

Hank Thompson -- guy at my gun club -- starts shooting way better than he usually does. So I ask him what his secret is. Ladies underpants, he says. It relaxes him, slows his heartbeat, which steadies his aim. So I tried it, and I started shooting a lot better. So I added skirt, wig, makeup, some pumps -- next thing you know, I'm top marksman at my gun club. Oh, and you know what else? Works for bowling, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : That's weird.

Surprise! [1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Alison </b> : Laura, have you interviewed Count Blah yet? He is such a talent, and so professional.</dd><dd> <b>  Warren </b> : Oh, yes, if by professional, you mean stealing his entire act from a Sesame Street character.</dd><dd> <b>  Blah </b> : That's a filthy lie! That son-of-a-bitch stole my bit, blah!</dd><dd> <b>  Alison </b> : Blah and the--and the Count from Sesame Street have this, like, playful rivalry. I love when you do that.

Well, my, my -- they must be using some awfully big words on the Cartoon Network.</dd><dd> <b>  Dottie </b> : Actually, Laura, I studied astronomy in college.

Us. The show.</dd><dd> <b>  Warren </b> : This could be perfect.

Season 1
Surprise! [1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : Leo Tolstoy began "Anna Karenina" by writing that all happy families resemble one another, while every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Yeah, that's right -- I've read the first page of a lot of books.</dd></dl>

Father &amp; Son Reunion [1.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : Well, when you think about it, father-son relationships are a lot like omelets. You know, the more you put into them, the better they're going to be. Nobody likes them when they're cold, and if you want to make a good one, sometimes you got to break a few eggs.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Father &amp; Son Reunion [1.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : History is filled with fathers and sons who just can't get along. Oedipus and Mr. Oedipus. Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Son of Sam and Sam. You know, it makes you wonder if fathers and sons will always be destined to collide.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Jimmy </b> : I don't know if this is going to work.</dd><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : Dude, it's time travel. How hard could it be? If I'm successful, I will go back to 1988 and stop them from making Back to the Future 3.</dd></dl>

But the point is, you know, if you're the one calling the shots, well, then there's always going to be some people who get, well, pissed. But there are also always going to be people who will look out for you, and make sure that they've got you covered no matter what comes down.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Piddler on the Roof [1.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : Being in a position of authority rarely makes you popular. In high school, I thought my service as a hall monitor might have gotten me elected homecoming king. But instead, it made me the football team's favorite toilet brush.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Piddler on the Roof [1.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Warren </b> : Of course. Of course. Well, let her know that I would be willing to do a monologue on the show tomorrow. Perhaps Claudius' angst over the murder of his brother might be fun for the kiddies.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Blah Bawls [1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Greg </b> : You know, I really learned something that day. Something besides the fact that Jimmy has to get a new car, because, let me tell you, these little side trips to the cemetery are way too emotionally draining. I learned that, you know, even though it's scary to let go of the past, being able to do so is a true test of character.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Blah Bawls [1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Blah </b> : Oh, you'll be fine. Besides, if you're always retracing your footsteps, you'll never make new ones, blah.</dd><dd> <b>  Warren </b> : That's a little odd coming from somebody whose idea of a hot date is to sob uncontrollably to a marble slab.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Gil </b> : This thing between you and Maggie. Is it, uh, serious?</dd><dd> <b>  Blah </b> : No, it's just a one-time thing. Well, technically, it's a four-time thing. But just one night.</dd><dd> <b>  Gil </b> : Four?</dd><dd> <b>  Blah </b> : I'm a little rusty...</dd></dl>
