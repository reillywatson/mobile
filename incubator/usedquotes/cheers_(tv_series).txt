I know that this idea didn't succeed, but others will.</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : No no, Diane. Look, a few minutes ago, I almost made the biggest mistake of my professional life and it was because I was doing something that just wasn't me. I am not a go-getter, I've never been a go-getter, what's more, I don't even want to be a go-getter. I'm very happy right where I am. I'm so sick of all these people saying "Peterson, you gotta push", "You gotta get ahead", "You gotta make that goal". I don't even want to make the goal, Diane. I want to be a bench warmer. The world needs bench warmers. If there were no bench warmers, what would we have? Cold benches. A lot of cold benches and the world does not need that. You know something, I'm very happy with being an anonymous cog in this field of work.</dd><dd> <b>  Diane </b> : Norman, I've never seen you so impassioned like this before.</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : That's because I believe in this, Diane. I'll tell you something else, Norm Peterson may be a motionless lump, but he's a damn good one.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Woody </b> : So, tonight, when I got out in front of that audience, I ripped off every stitch of clothing. I looked around and I thought, "Why am I the only one who's naked?"</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : Well, maybe nobody noticed, Wood.</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Oh, they noticed, Sam.</dd><dd> <b>  Woody </b> : As if that wasn't bad enough, I heard this high-pitched scream from the audience, "Hey, look!

The Ghost and Mrs. LeBec[8.23]

Season 8
The Ghost and Mrs. LeBec[8.23]
<dl><dd> <b>  Lilith </b> : Well kudos to Carla. It's healthy after a time to curtail one's grieving and recommence interest in the opposite sex. I know if my Frasier were taken from me in an unforeseen tragedy I would certainly date again after an acceptable period of bereavement.</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : That gives me a warm fuzzy.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilith </b> : There'd be no sense in being overly emotional, darling. You'd be dead and rotting in a box.</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Woody, can I have another beer and would you check on the robot over there and check if it's thirsty.</dd><dd> <b>  Woody </b> : Hey Dr. Crane, that's your wife.

You've been going out with Kelly for over a year and you're not sleepin' with her?</dd><dd> <b>  Woody </b> : Of course not. That's the sort of this you wait to do after you're married. Right, Mr. Peterson?</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : Well you keep believing that, Woody.</dd></dl>
Season 8

Season 8
Cry Hard[8.25]
<dl><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : I cannot believe that Robin would use me like this.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : Yeah I know. He seems like such a decent guy. It's not like he ever, you know, cheated on any of your friends on a business deal. No, no actually he did, didn't he? Well at least you never caught him with another woman. Oh shoot that happened too. Well maybe this is the very last bad thing he does. Yeah that's it.</dd><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : Gee Sam, you think so?</dd></dl>
Season 8
Cry Harder[8.26]
<dl><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : I know how we should celebrate. Why don't you just take me right on top of the bar like you did in the old days?</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : I never did that.</dd><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : Then who was that guy? Oh that was the manager of the bar where I worked before this. Hey can anyone give me a ride to The Broken Spoke?</dd></dl>

And I just came back to say that I'm sorry I ran out earlier in a huff. And that I knew you weren't coming on to me. And when you said I wasn't good that it wasn't just some trick to get me back into bed it was because you were being honest because I am a lousy lover.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : No, sweetheart you're not.</dd><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : Sam, it's alright. It's not like I haven't heard it before.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : You're a fantastic lover.</dd><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : I'm a dud and I know it. Robin just didn't realize it because he's English.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : Listen. I wouldn't say you were good if you weren't.</dd><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : No, no Sam that doesn't wash. You've been after me for three years and you finally got me. I mean if I was even adequate I know that you would've run out there and told every bozo in the bar.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : You don't think I was dying to do that? It was making me crazy. It's just that I thought I would be betraying our friendship. I've never had a friend before.</dd><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : You have lots of friends!</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : No, no I've never <i>  had </i> a friend before.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : I've just been feeling a bit edgy these days.</dd><dd> <b>  Woody </b> : Why's that Dr. Crane?</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Lilith in her own compulsive little way made the mistake of asking me if I thought she looked fat.</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : And what did you say?</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : I told her she looked just fine.</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : Rookie mistake. So what kind of punishment are you getting?</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : I'm not getting any.</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : Oh you got off easy.</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : No, I'm not getting any.</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : No, you're getting off easy.</dd></dl>

Rebecca Redux[9.3]
<dl><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : I would like to nominate as the stupidest creature on earth: the one who awakens each day to drive through gridlocked traffic, to sit in a window less office breathing recirculated air, then returns home and collapses into a stupor, only to do the same damn thing all over again every day until he dies.</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : Looking forward to that vacation, hey Frase?</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : You bet.

No siree sir.</dd><dd> <b>  Woody </b> : I don't get it, Mr. Clavin.

Allo means..."I've got your girlfriend in my arms, and soon we'll be naked, you stupid cuckold."</dd><dd> <b>  Cliff </b> : That's funny, Norm, because I thought it meant..."I got your girlfriend in my arms, and we're already naked, you stupid cuckold."</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Stop heckling the poor lad.

Season 9
Honor Thy Mother[9.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Very often that's the best thing you can do when you're not getting along with a family member. Remove yourself entirely from them.

Season 9
Honor Thy Mother[9.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Carla, death is an earthly scientific passage predicted by either massive physical injury or progressive bodily deterioration. There is as little validity in a supposed death dream as there is in the cliched image of death itself as a grim bloodless ghoul who's bony finger reaches out to tap you on the shoulder when your number's up.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilith </b> : <i>  [taps Frasier's shoulder] </i> Frasier, it's time to go.</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : <i>  [Screams] </i> Don't do that, woman.

Season 9
Achilles Hill[9.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : Fools, non believers, can't you see what the evil [foosball table] has done? You're trapped.

I'm just not particularly looking forward to it.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : You know I don't get that. All you've done the last two years is talk about getting married to this guy.</dd><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : Well I'll tell you. It is one thing to love somebody who's serving time for you. It's another thing serving time <i>  with </i> them.</dd></dl>
Season 9

Season 9
Wedding Bell Blues[9.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : Guys listen up for a second please. When Rebecca comes in she's probably not going to be feeling too good so just take it easy on her. All right?</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : What's the problem, Sam?</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : She called off the whole wedding.</dd><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : Get out.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : I went over there last night. She was a real mess. She was clear about one thing. She doesn't love [Robin] and there's no way she's gonna marry him.</dd><dd> <i>  [Rebecca enters wearing a wedding dress with a smile on her face] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : Yeah Sam, she's in agony.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilith </b> : Ordinarily Sam, people don't deal with depression by putting on a wedding dress and acting giddy.</dd><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : Except maybe Clavin.</dd></dl>

Wedding Bell Blues[9.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Rebecca </b> : <i>  [from the back room] </i> I need somebody to talk to. Anybody. I really need some help. <i>  [Paul walks back and comes right back out] </i> Not Paul!</dd><dd> <b>  Paul </b> : I can't help somebody who doesn't want to be helped.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Woody, I think it was a great sacrifice for you to give your clothes to Rebecca. It puts me in mind of another novel by my favorite British author. You know who I mean. I'll give you a hint, Charles...</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : In Charge?</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Are you people really this ignorant or do you do this just to torture me?</dd><dd> <b>  Norm </b> : Sometimes the two go hand in hand.</dd></dl>
Season 9
Sam Time Next Year[9.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Woody </b> : I don't know, Dr. Crane. Haven't you ever thought that it's kind of tough on them - doing all that counseling stuff? I mean I was raised to believe that if you have a problem, you lock it away in a secret place. You keep it bottled up good and tight. And if it gets full in there, you just keep forcing the pain down and clamping it in.</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Good advice, Woody. <i>  [to Norm] </i> Tick... tick... tick.</dd></dl>

The gargoyle has just fallen off Notre Dame and is now taking drink orders.</dd><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : You know two heads like that would make a perfectly good butt.</dd><dd> <b>  John Hill </b> : Shrike.</dd><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : Bullet head.</dd><dd> <b>  John Hill </b> : Slattern.</dd><dd> <b>  Carla </b> : Hatchet face.</dd><dd> <b>  John Hill </b> : Well must be off.

It's a Wonderful Wife[9.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  John Hill </b> : My hat check girl is missing from her post. You haven't perchance seen her?</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : What's that supposed to mean?

It's far more enticing if you need her more than she needs you.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilith </b> : Who is this she you're talking about, Frasier?</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Purely hypothetical.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilith </b> : It's a little strange for a happily married man to go prattling on about a mistress.</dd><dd> <b>  Frasier </b> : Oh come on, hon.

You see they're way ahead of us in technology but they don't have our creativity.</dd></dl>

Why would any girl be caught dead with you when she could be with me?</dd><dd> <b>  Paul </b> : You thought that would offend me?</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : I'm serious. What did you do? Slip her a mickey or something?</dd><dd> <b>  Paul </b> : Well since you asked me so nicely Sam, I'll tell ya. Paula is what we like to refer to as a chubby chaser.</dd><dd> <b>  Sam </b> : You're kidding. You mean she like to go out with guys who are uh...</dd><dd> <b>  Paul </b> : Portly Sam. The word is portly.</dd></dl>
