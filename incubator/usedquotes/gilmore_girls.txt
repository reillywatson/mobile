Now, I don't know John, and I certainly don't know Kyle, but I do know someone who would get into a fight at a party and leave the place completely trashed.

<dl><dd> <b>  Dave </b> : A few weeks ago you told me that Lane had a crush on me. Well, I have a crush on her, too. Now, I know you have very strict rules about dating and boys, but I just want you to know that I'm a good person. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I've never gotten a ticket, I'm healthy, I take care of myself, I floss. I never watch more than 30 minutes of television a night partly because I think it's a waste of time and partly because there's nothing on. I respect my parents, I do well in school, I never play video games in case they do someday prove that playing them can turn you into a serial killer. I don't drink coffee. I hate soda because the carbonation freaks me out. I'm happy to give up meat if you feel strongly about it. I don't mind wearing a tie. I enjoy playing those hymns on my guitar, and I really, really want to take your daughter to the prom.</dd><dd> <i>  [Mrs. Kim is silent.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Dave </b> : Mrs. Kim?

<dl><dd> <b>  Rory </b> : Headmaster Charleston, faculty members, fellow students, family and friends, welcome. We never thought this day would come. We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars, counted hours, minutes and seconds and now that it's here, I'm sorry it is, because it means leaving friends who inspire me and teachers who've been my mentors, so many people who've shaped my life, and my fellow students lives impermeably and forever. I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County , hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod , fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly , rode a sad train with Anna Karenina and strolled down Swann's Way . It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric, but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything. Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars, without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore...</dd><dd> <b>  Sookie </b> : (With tears in her eyes) Uh, oh -</dd><dd> <b>  Lorelai </b> : (Also on the verge of crying) Hang in there.</dd><dd> <b>  Rory </b> : My mother never gave me any idea that I couldn't do whatever I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be.

As she guided me through these incredible eighteen years, I don't know if she ever realized that the person I most wanted to be was her...</dd><dd> <b>  Sookie </b> : (Choked up) Not crying.</dd><dd> <b>  Lorelai </b> : (Slightly crying) Crying a little.</dd><dd> <b>  Sookie </b> : Crying a little, but not blubbering.

We go in, sit down, they close the door. Turned out to be a guy playing musical drinking glasses . You know, with the half-filled cups that give off different tones. He played Mozart , and I swear I could hear Mozart banging on his coffin. Out of politeness, we stayed, and there went an hour of our lives. Next night, the sign in front of the theater said the entertainment for the night was a guy singing the songs of Sinatra. We verified with the guy at the door, the songs of Frank Sinatra , right? Not Tina, not Frank Jr. , not Bill Sinatra, but Ol' Blue Eyes. "Yes," he says. "It's like Frank come to life." We go in, sit down, they close the door. Then they announce that the guy singing Sinatra is sick and the glass-playing guy is filling in. Out he comes, there's goes another hour. Next night, we meet a nice couple while walking the Lido Deck. Had some nice conversation, so we have dinner with them. Everything's going great. Then they invite us to go somewhere afterwards. Guess where they took us. That's right, to see the glass guy. Three night in a row, Three hours total. Well that's what I want. I want three hours back!</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Blodgett </b> : We'll have to confer on this.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Stein 1 </b> : Maybe do a productivity study.</dd><dd> <b>  Luke </b> : Yeah, get Blobb, Fromm and Pinnuccio in there, too.</dd></dl>

I am hurt on a level you will not be able to understand until you yourself have a daughter or a granddaughter who will cut your heart out the way you've just cut mine out, and I hope that small veneer of independence that you've extracted from this incident is worth the complete and total alienation of the grandparents who have done nothing but love you and thought of you only."</dd><dd> <b>  Rory </b> : Or I could keep the furniture.</dd></dl>

But it's not going to be perfect. He's not perfect, and God knows you're not perfect. But marriage is not about always being happy, and often it's about not being happy at all. It's about compromise, which is not your strong suit. It's about swallowing your pride sometimes, about doing what he wants. It's not about winning an argument, which may make you sad, because that's what you love. But I don't want to see you ruin this. Marriage is serious business, Lorelai, and if you don't take this seriously, it could fall apart faster than you could possibly imagine. And he'll be gone, and you'll be alone again.
