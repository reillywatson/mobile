<dl><dd> <i>  [Opening voiceover.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mohinder </b> : Where does it come from? This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries when the simplest of questions can never be answered. Why are we here? What is the soul? Why do we dream? Perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all. Not delving, not yearning. That's not human nature. Not the human heart. That is not why we are here.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Mohinder </b> : Man is a narcissistic species by nature. We have colonized the four corners of our tiny planet. But we are not the pinnacle of so-called evolution. That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach. Capable of living for months without food. Remaining alive headless for weeks at a time. Resistant to radiation. If God has indeed created Himself in His own image, then I submit to you that God is a cockroach.</dd></dl>

Moments like these can change the nature of the battle, and turn the tide for either side. So we do what we can to understand them. To be ready for change, we steady our hearts, curb our fears, muster our forces, and look for signs in the stars. But these moments, these game changes, remain a mystery. Destiny's invisible hand, moving pieces on a chessboard. No matter how much we prepare for them - how much we resist the change, anticipate the moment, fight the inevitable outcome - in the end, we are never truly ready when it strikes. </i></dd></dl>

Dual[3.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sylar </b> : <i>  [opening voiceover]] </i> On the sixth day, God created Man in His own image, now it's up to us to figure it all out. Right...wrong...good...evil...in each of us is the capacity to decide what drives our actions. So what is it, then, that makes some choose selflessness, the need to devote oneself to something greater, while others know only self-interest? Isolating themselves in a world of their own making? Some seek love, even if only unrequited, while others are driven by fear and betrayal. There are those who see their choices as dark proof of God's absence while others follow a path of noble destiny. But in the end, good, evil, right or wrong...what we choose is never what we really need. For that is the ultimate cosmic joke, the real gift that God has left behind.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Mohinder Suresh </b> : <i>  [ending voiceover] </i> There is good, and there is evil. Right, and wrong. Heroes and villains. And if we are blessed with wisdom, then there are glimpses between the cracks of each where light streams through. We wait in silence for these times, when sense can be made. When meaningless existence comes into focus, and our purpose presents itself. And if we have the strength to be honest, and what we find there, staring back at us, is our own reflection. Bearing witness to the duality of life. And each one of us is capable of both the dark, and the light.. the good and evil, of either, of all. And destiny, while marching ever in our direction can be rerouted by the choices we make. By the love we hold on to, and the promises we keep.</dd></dl>

Orientation[4.01a]
<dl><dd> <b>  Samuel </b> : My brother Joseph and I have had two families. The first one... well let's just say it didn't work out too well. But over the years, we made ourselves a new one. And it was to this family, all of you, that his heart really belonged. You see, a family is something that Joseph and I needed. It offers protection from the outside world. A world that never understood or appreciated what makes us different. There are others like us out there, in the shadows, in the light. Each grasping for a meaning in a world that won't accept them for who they really are. They, like us, are blessed, gifted with extraordinary abilities. And they, like us, struggle with finding their place in an ordinary world. Haunted by their past from those who would harm them and keep them from their destiny. Every one of them deserves a chance to be who they really are. But to what end? For what purpose? Here in this place, we offer salvation. We offer hope, we offer redemption. And one by one, they will come to our side, to our family. And they will find their way home. And all who have gathered, will be strong. And all who have gathered, will stand in unison. I say it's time we found our way back home again. Find your way home, brother.</dd></dl>
