Season 1
Welcome to the Hellmouth
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well... when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or, or witty. Or at all. I-I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's not <i>  that </i> bad.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : No, i-it is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You really <i>  haven't </i> been dating lately.</dd></dl>

Live in the now, okay? You look like <i>  DeBarge </i> !</dd><dd> <i>  [The vampires close in on Buffy. She turns to Darla.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Now, we can do this the hard way, or... well, actually there's just the hard way.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : That's fine with me!</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Are you sure?

Season 1
The Harvest
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : <i>  [To Willow] </i> Well then help me in researching this Harvest affair. It seems to be some sort of preordained massacre. Rivers of blood, hell on Earth. Quite charmless. I'm a bit fuzzy, however, on the details. <i>  [about a computer] </i> It may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine. <i>  [everyone stares] </i> That was a bit, um, British, wasn't it?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Welcome to the New World.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Harvest
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : This is just too much. I mean, yesterday my life's like, 'Uh-oh, pop quiz.' Today it's 'Rain of Toads'.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I know. And everyone else thinks it's just a normal day.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Nobody knows. It's like we've got this big secret.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : We do. That's what a secret is, when you know something other guys don't.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Harvest
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Oh, yeah, that's a plan. Cause lots of schools aren't on Hellmouths.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I was thinking of a more subtle approach, ya know, like excessive not studying.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : <i>  [to himself] </i> The Earth is doomed.</dd></dl>

Teacher's Pet
<dl><dd> <b>  Principal Flutie </b> : We all need help with our feelings. Otherwise we bottle them up, and before you know it, powerful laxatives are involved. I really believe if we all reach out to one another we can beat this thing. I'm always here if you need a hug, (jumps back) but not a real hug! Because there's no touching, this school is sensitive to wrong touching.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Teacher's Pet

Season 1
The Pack
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What is it with those guys?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : They're obnoxious. Professionally.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, every school has 'em. See, you start a new school, you get your desks, some blackboards and some mean kids.</dd></dl>

He's turned into a sixteen-year-old boy. Of course you'll have to kill him.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Pack
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Testosterone is a great equalizer, it turns all men into morons.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Angel
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : <i>  [about Angel] </i> So he is a good vampire? I mean on a scale of one to ten. Ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night, one being someone who's... not.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Angel
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : The elders conjured the most perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body, but it doesn't get your soul; that's gone. No conscience, no remorse, it's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done...and care. I haven't fed on a human being since that day.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Angel
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I invited you into my home and then you attacked my family.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Why not? I killed mine. I killed their friends... and their friends' children...

Season 1
Angel
<dl><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : <i>  [about Angel] </i> I made him. There was a time when we shared everything, wasn't there Angelus? You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the Master's court for a thousand years, but you threw that away because of her. You love someone who hates us. You're sick. And you'll always be sick. And you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die.</dd></dl>

Season 1
I, Robot... You, Jane
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I'm just going to stay and clean up a little. I'll be back in the Middle Ages.</dd><dd> <b>  Jenny </b> : Did you ever leave?</dd></dl>
Season 1
I, Robot... You, Jane
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I-I-I really don't know how to advise you. Things involved with a computer fill me with a childlike terror. Now, if it were a nice ogre or some such I'd be more in my element.</dd></dl>
Season 1
I, Robot... You, Jane
<dl><dd> <b>  Jenny </b> : You kids really dig the library, don't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : We're literary.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : To read makes our speaking English good.</dd></dl>
Season 1
I, Robot... You, Jane
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Are we over-reacting? He's in a computer, what can he do?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You mean besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me? I don't know. How about mess up all the medical equipment in the world?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Randomize traffic signals.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Access launch codes for our nuclear missiles.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Destroy the world's economy.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I think I pretty much capped it with that nuclear missile thing.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Right, yours was best.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Puppet Show
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : He thought it would behoove me to have more contact with the students. I did try to explain that my vocational choice of librarian was a deliberate attempt to minimize said contact, but he would have none of it.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Puppet Show
<dl><dd> <b>  Principal Snyder </b> : My predecessor, Mr. Flutie, may have gone in for all that touchy-feely relating nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in <i>  my </i> world now. And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Puppet Show
<dl><dd> <b>  Sid (the dummy) </b> : <i>  (in short, about his present condition) </i> Lets just say there was me, there was a really mean demon, there was a curse, and the next thing I know, I'm not me any more. I'm sitting on some guy's knee, with his hand up my shirt.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Puppet Show
<dl><dd> <i>  [Marc has tricked Giles into getting into a craftily disguised guillotine.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?</dd><dd> <b>  Marc </b> : No, no this way your scalp gets sliced off and your brains just come pouring out.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : What exactly is the trick?</dd><dd> <b>  Marc </b> : Trick?</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Puppet Show
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What about the whole "it's a demon" theory?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I'm looking into that, but my investigation is somewhat... hampered by our life in the theater.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Uh, priority check, Giles? <i>  (holding up her hands) </i> Talent show, murder.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah, we can't do the talent show, it's unthinkable. I'm not able to think it!</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Principal Snyder is watching us all very closely. Now, if he chooses, he can make all our lives extremely difficult. A Slayer cannot afford that! We will find this murderer, but in the meantime... the show must go on.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : This is so unfair.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Nightmares
<dl><dd> <b>  Joyce </b> : You want to go to school?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Sure! Why not?</dd><dd> <b>  Joyce </b> : Okay. Good day to buy that lottery ticket.</dd></dl>

What's his place in Venice society?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well, everyone looked down on him.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : That is such a twinkie defense . Shylock should get over himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike. It was the most traumatizing event of <i>  my </i> life, and she's trying to make it about <i>  her </i> leg! Like <i>  my </i> pain meant nothing.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Out of Mind, Out of Sight
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Buffy told me you don't feed from humans anymore.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Not for a long while.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Is that why you're here? To see her?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I can't. It's, uh... It's too hard for me to be around her.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : A vampire in love with a Slayer. It's rather poetic... in a maudlin sort of way.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Out of Mind, Out of Sight
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : 'Have a nice summer', 'Have a nice summer'. This girl had no friends at all.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generational gap.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : 'Have a nice summer' is what you write when you have nothing to say.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : It's the kiss of death.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Out of Mind, Out of Sight
<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : So, are you saying she's invisible because she's so unpopular?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : That about sums it up.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Bummer for her. It's awful to feel that lonely.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Hmm. So you've read something about the feeling?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Hey! You think I'm never lonely because I'm so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It's not like any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like me half the time. People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at being popular?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Prophecy Girl
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : <i>  [practicing to ask Buffy to the Spring Fling dance] </i> Y'know, Buffy, Spring Fling just isn't any dance. It's a time for students to choose, um... a mate and then we can... observe their... mating rituals and tag them before they migrate- just kill me!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Prophecy Girl
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : <i>  [about the prophecy] </i> Well, there's gotta be some way around it.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Listen, some prophecies are-are a bit dodgy. They're-they're mutable. Buffy herself has-has thwarted them time and time again, but this is the Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Then you're reading it wrong.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I wish to God I were. But it's very plain. Tomorrow night Buffy will face the Master, and she will die.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Prophecy Girl
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : How could you let her go?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : As the soon-to-be-purple area of my jaw will attest, I did not <i>  let </i> her go!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Prophecy Girl
<dl><dd> <b>  Master </b> : You're dead.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.</dd><dd> <b>  The Master </b> : You were destined to die! It was written!</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What can I say? I flunked the written.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Prophecy Girl
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  (about the prophecy in which she will die) </i> So that's it, huh? I remember the drill. One slayer dies, the next one's called. I wonder who she is. Will you train her? Or will they send someone else?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Buffy... I...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [wimpering] </i> Does it say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt? <i>  [as Angel steps close to her] </i> Don't touch me! Were you even gonna tell me?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I was hoping I wouldn't have to, that there was some way around it. I...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I've got a way around it. I quit.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : It's not that simple.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I'm making it that simple. I quit. I resign, I-I'm fired, you can find someone else to stop The Master from taking over.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I'm not sure that anyone else can. All the... the signs indicate...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [enraged, throwing books at Giles] </i> The signs?! Read me the signs! Tell me my fortune! You're so useful sitting here with all of your books! You're really a lot of help!</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I don't suppose I am</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I know this is hard.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What do you know about this? You're never gonna die</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You think I want anything to happen to you? You think I could stand it? We just gotta figure out a way...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I already did. I quit, remember. Pay attention!</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Buffy, if the Master rises...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I don't care! I don't care. Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't wanna die.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Principal Snyder </b> : The first day back. It always gets me.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Principal Snyder </b> : I mean, it's incredible. One day the campus is completely bare. Empty. The next, there are children everywhere. Like locusts. Crawling around, mindlessly bent on feeding and mating. Destroying everything in sight in their relentless, pointless desire to exist.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I do enjoy these pep talks. Have you ever considered, given your abhorrence of children, school's principal was not, perhaps, your true vocation?</dd><dd> <i>  [Giles sees Jenny and starts talking to her ignoring Snyder] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Principal Snyder </b> : Somebody's got to keep an eye on them. They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. You think they're thinking about learning? Every time a pretty girl walks by every boy turns into a bumbling idiot. I try to teach them the important things in life. Discipline. Respect. Punctuality. I might as well be talking to myself.</dd><dd> <i>  [Snyder doesn't notice that Giles has left] </i></dd></dl>

So, did you guys fight any demons this summer?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Uh, yes!

<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : She's possessed!</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Possessed?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : That's the only explanation that makes any sense. I mean, you should've seen her last night. That wasn't Buffy.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Are we overlooking the idea that she may be very attracted to me? <i>  [gets looks from the others and concedes] </i> She's possessed.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Possessed by what?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Aaaaa possessing thing!</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : <i>  [sarcastically] </i> Well, that narrows it down.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, you're the expert. Hey, maybe when the Master killed her some... mystical bad guy transference thing happened.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : That's what it was! I mean, why else would she be acting like such a b-i-t-c-h?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Willow, I think we're all a little too old to be spelling things out.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : A bitca?</dd></dl>

You know, we've never really been close which is good cause I don't really like you that much. But you have been know to save the world on occasion, so I'm going to give you a piece of advice.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Which is?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Get over it.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Excuse me?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Whatever is causing the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it. Embrace the pain, spank your inner moppet, whatever, but get over it. 'Cause pretty soon you're not even gonna have the loser friends you've got now.</dd></dl>

I mean, you can dry-clean till Judgment Day, you are living with those stains.</dd><dd> <b>  Jenny </b> : Yeah that's the worst part of being hung upside down by a vampire who wants to slit your throat. The stains.</dd></dl>

Some Assembly Required[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Are you jealous?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : <i>  (laughs a bit) </i> Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Is it 'cause I danced with him?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : <i>  Danced with </i> is a pretty loose term. <i>  Mated with </i> might be a little closer.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Don't you think you're being a little unfair? It was one little dance, which I only did to make you crazy, by the way. Behold my success.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I am <i>  not </i> jealous.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You're not jealous? What, vampires don't get jealous?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : See? Whenever we fight you always bring up the vampire thing.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Some Assembly Required[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : <i>  (digging in the grave yard as the girls watch) </i> Y'know, this might go a lot faster if you femmes actually picked up a shovel, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : <i>  (stopping, almost breathless) </i> Hear, hear.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Sorry, but I'm an old fashioned gal. I was raised to believe that men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Some Assembly Required[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : So, both coffins are empty. That makes three girls signed up for the army of zombies.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Is it an army if you just have three?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Zombie drill team then.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Some Assembly Required[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I don't get it. Why would anybody wanna make a girl?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : <i>  (bitterly) </i> You mean when there's so many pre-made ones just laying around? The things we do for love.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Love has nothing to do with this.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Maybe not, but I'll tell you this: people don't fall in love with what's right in front of them. People want the dream. What they can't have. The more unattainable, the more attractive.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Some Assembly Required[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, I guess that makes it official. Everybody's paired off. Vampires get dates. Hell, even the school librarian sees more action than me. You ever think that the world is a giant game of musical chairs, and the music's stopped and we're the only ones who don't have a chair?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : All the time.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia Chase </b> : Xander? I just wanted to thank you for saving my life. What you did in there was really brave and heroic, and I just wanted to tell you if there was anything that I could ever do to...</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Do you mind? We're talking here.</dd><dd> <i>  (Cordelia is taken aback, rolls her eyes and leaves.) </i></dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : So where were we?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Wondering why we never get dates.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah, so why do you think that is?</dd></dl>

School Hard[2.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : We were at the Bronze before. Thought you said you might show.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You said you weren't sure if you were going.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I was being cool. C'mon, you've been dating for, what, like, two hundred years? You don't know what a girl means when she says maybe she'll show?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Wow. Two centuries of dating. If you only had two a year, that's still like 400 dates with 400 different... <i>  [Awkward beat.] </i> Why do they call it a mace?</dd></dl>
Season 2
School Hard[2.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I taught you to always guard your perimeter. <i>  [tuts.] </i> You should have someone out there.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I did. I'm surrounded by idiots. What's new with you?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Everything.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Yeah. Come up against this slayer yet?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : She's cute. Not too bright, though. Gave her the puppy dog "I'm all tortured" act. Keeps her off my back when I feed.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : People still fall for that Anne Rice routine?

Inca Mummy Girl[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : That's Rodney Munson. What he lacks in smarts, he makes up for in lack of smarts.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You're just angry about that time he beat you up everyday for five years.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah. I'm irrational like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I better stop him before he gets in trouble.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I got it. The non-violent approach is probably better here. <i>  [goes over to Rodney] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I wasn't gonna use violence. I don't always use violence. Do I?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : The important thing is <i>  you </i> believe that.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Inca Mummy Girl[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : You have responsibilities that other girls do not.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Oh! I know this one! Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah blah biddy blah, I'm so stuffy, give me a scone.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : It's as if you know me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Inca Mummy Girl[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Devon MacLeish </b> : What does a girl have to do to impress you?</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Well, it involves a feather boa and the theme to A Summer Place . I can't discuss it here.</dd><dd> <b>  Devon </b> : You're too picky, man. Do you know how many girls you could have? You're lead guitar, Oz. It's currency!</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : I'm not picky.

Season 2
Inca Mummy Girl[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Okay, I have something to tell you. And it's kind of a secret, and it's, um, a little bit scary. I like you. A lot. And I want you to go to with me the dance.</dd><dd> <b>  Ampata </b> : <i>  [laughs] </i> Why was that so scary?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, because you never know if a girl's gonna say 'yes', or if... she's gonna laugh in your face and pull out your still beating heart and crush it into the ground with her heel.</dd><dd> <b>  Ampata </b> : Hmm. Then you are very courageous.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Inca Mummy Girl[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I just, present company excluded, I have the worst taste in women of anyone in the world, ever.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Ampata wasn't evil. At least not to begin with, and... I-I do think she cared about you.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah, but I think that whole sucking the life out of people thing would have been a strain on the relationship.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : She was gypped. She was just a girl, and she had her life taken away from her. I remember how I felt when I heard the prophecy that I was gonna die. I wasn't exactly obsessed with doing the right thing.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah, but you did. You gave up your life.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I had you to bring me back.</dd></dl>

What do you think is happening?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You're 16 years old, I'm 241.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I've done the math.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You don't know what you're doing. You don't know what you want.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Oh, no, I, I think I do. I want out of this conversation.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Listen, if we date, you and I both know one thing's going to lead to another.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : One thing already <i>  has </i> led to another. You think it's a little late to be reading me a warning label?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I'm just trying to protect you. This could get out of control.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : <i>  [grabs her roughly] </i> This isn't some fairy tale. When I kiss you, you don't wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : No. When you kiss me I want to die.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Reptile Boy[2.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You lied to Giles.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I wasn't lying. I was just... protecting him from information that he wouldn't be able to... digest properly.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Like a corn dog.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Like you don't have a sick mother, but you'd rather go to a frat party where there's gonna be drinking and older guys and probably an orgy.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho, rewind. Since when do they have orgies, and why aren't I on the mailing list?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : There's no orgies!</dd></dl>
Season 2
Reptile Boy[2.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Angel barely says two words to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Don't you hate that?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : And when he does, he treats me like I'm a child.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : That bastard!</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You know, at least Tom can carry on a conversation.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah! <i>  (pause) </i> Tom? Who's Tom?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : The frat guy.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Oh, Buffy, I don't think so. Frying pan, fire? You know what I'm sayin'?</dd></dl>
Season 2

<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : She lied to me?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well...</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Did... she have a date?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : <i>  (to Angel) </i> Well, why do you think she went to that party? Because you gave her the brush-off! <i>  (to Giles) </i> And you never let her do anything except work and patrol! And I know she's the Chosen One, but you're killing her with the pressure! I mean, she's sixteen going on forty! <i>  (to Angel) </i> And you! I mean, you're gonna live forever! You don't have time for a cup of coffee?? Okay, I don't feel better now, and we've got to help Buffy.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Reptile Boy[2.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I told one lie, I had one drink.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The words "let that be a lesson" are a tad redundant at this juncture.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Halloween[2.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : It's too bad we can't sneak a look at the <i>  Watcher Diaries </i> and read up on Angel. I'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Yeah. It's too bad. That stuff is private.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Also Giles keeps them in his office. In his personal files.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Most importantly, it would be <i>  wrong </i> .</dd></dl>
Season 2
Halloween[2.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Angel's a vampire, I thought you knew.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Oh, he's a <i>  vampire </i> ! Of course! But the cuddly kind, like a Care Bear with fangs.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Halloween[2.06]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Buffy admonishes Willow on her choice of a boring ghost costume.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's just ... You're never gonna get noticed if you keep hiding! You're missing the whole point of Halloween.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Free candy?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's "come as you <i>  aren't </i> " night! The perfect chance for a girl to get sexy and wild, with no repercussions.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Oh, I don't get wild. Wild on me equals spaz.</dd></dl>

Halloween[2.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Ta da. Just little old 20th-century me.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Sure you're okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I'll live.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I don't get it, Buffy. Why'd you think I'd like you better dressed that way?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I just wanted to be a real girl for once. The kind of fancy girl you liked when you were my age.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Oh, ho.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I hated the girls back then. Especially the noblewomen.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You did.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : They were just incredibly dull. Simpering morons, the lot of them. I always wished I could meet someone ... exciting. Interesting.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Really? Interesting how?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You know how.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Still, I had a really hard day. You should probably tell me.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You're right. I should.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Definitely.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Lie to Me[2.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : I just don't see why everyone's always picking on Marie-Antoinette . I can so relate to her. She worked really hard to look that good, and people just don't appreciate that kind of effort. And I know the peasants were all depressed ...</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I think you mean <i>  oppressed </i> .</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Whatever. They were cranky. So they're like, "Let's lose some heads." Uh! That's fair. And Marie-Antoinette cared about them. She was gonna let them have cake!</dd></dl>
Season 2
Lie to Me[2.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Uh, Angel? If I say something you really don't want to hear, do you promise not to bite me?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Are you going to tell me that I'm jealous?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well, you do sometimes get that way.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You know, I never used to. Things used to be pretty simple. A hundred years, just hanging out, feeling guilty ... I really honed my brooding skills. Then <i>  she </i> comes along. Yeah, I get jealous. But I know people. And my gut tells me this is a wrong guy.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Lie to Me[2.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : He left no paper trail. That's incriminating enough.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I'm going to have to go with Deadboy on this.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Could ya not call me that?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Lie to Me[2.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Do you love me?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Do you?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I love you. I don't know if I trust you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Maybe you shouldn't do either.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Maybe I'm the one who should decide!</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I did a lot of unconscionable things when I became a vampire. Drusilla was the worst. She was ... an obsession of mine. She was pure, and sweet, and chaste.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : And you made her a vampire.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : First I made her insane. Killed everybody she loved. Visited every mental torture on her I could devise. She eventually fled to a convent, and on the day she took her holy orders, I turned her into a demon.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well. I asked for the truth.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Lie to Me[2.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I believe that's called growing up.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Then I'd like to stop, okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I know the feeling.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Does it ever get easy?</dd><dd> <i>  (Ford rises from the ground and attacks Buffy, she stakes him) </i></dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : You mean life?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Yeah. Does it get easy?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : What do you want me to say?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Lie to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Yes, it's terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, uh, we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Liar.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Dark Age[2.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Giles lived for school. He's actually still bitter that there are only twelve grades.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : He probably sat in math class thinking, "There should be more math. This could be mathier."</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Dark Age[2.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Um, a medical transport is delivering the monthly supply of blood to the hospital.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Mm. Vampire Meals-On-Wheels.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Dark Age[2.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yep, yep, I knew this would happen. Nobody can be wound as straight and narrow as Giles without a dark side erupting. My Uncle Rory was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. By night, it was booze, whores, and fur flying. Were there whores?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : He was alone.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Give it time.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Dark Age[2.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Xander, how do you feel about digging through some of Giles' personal files and seeing what you can find?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I feel pretty good about it. Does that make me a sociopath? Nah.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Dark Age[2.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I'm not gonna lie to you. It was scary. I'm so used to you being a grownup, and then I find out that you're a person.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Most grownups are.</dd></dl>
Season 2
What's My Line, Part One[2.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : "Are you a people person, or do you prefer keeping your own company?" Well, what if I'm a people person who keeps his own company by default?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : So, mark "none of the above".</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, there are no boxes for "none of the above". That would introduce too many variables into their mushroom head, number-crunching little world.</dd></dl>
Season 2
What's My Line, Part One[2.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : What, and suck all the spontaneity out of being young and stupid? I'd rather live in the dark.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You're not gonna be young forever.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yes, but I'll always be stupid. <i>  [silence.

What's My Line, Part One[2.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Dalton </b> : Yes, but ... The Order of Taraka. I mean, isn't that overkill?</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : No, I think it's just enough kill.</dd></dl>
Season 2
What's My Line, Part One[2.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : I can't even believe you. You dragged me out of bed for a ride? What am I, mass transportation?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : That's what a lot of the guys say, but it's just locker room talk. I wouldn't pay it any mind.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Oh, great, so now I'm your taxi and your punching bag.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I like to think of you more as my witless foil, but have it your way.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : You know what? I'm going. I'd rather be worm food than look at your pathetic face!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Then go! I'm not stopping you!</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : I bet you wouldn't. I bet you'd let a girl go off to her doom all by herself!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Not just any girl. You're special.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : I can't believe that I'm stuck spending what will probably be my last few moments on Earth here with you!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I hope these are my last few moments. Three more seconds with you and I'm gonna...</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : "I'm gonna" what? <i>  [steps closer] </i> Coward!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Moron!</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : I hate you!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I hate you!</dd><dd> <i>  [They kiss] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : ...We <i>  so </i> need to get out of here!</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : <i>  [nods, frightened] </i> Uh huh.</dd></dl>
Season 2
What's My Line, Part Two[2.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : There's a Slayer handbook?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Wait. Handbook? What handbook? How come I don't have a handbook?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Is there a T-shirt, too? 'Cause that would be cool...</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : After meeting you, Buffy, I realized that, uh, the handbook would be of no use in your case.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well, what do you mean it would be of no use in my case? Wha- what's wrong with my case?</dd></dl>

How's your arm?</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Suddenly painless.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You can still play guitar okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Not well, but not worse.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You know, I never really thanked you.</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Please don't. I don't do thanks. I get all red and I have to bail. It's not pretty.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well then forget-that thing. Especially the part where I kind of owe you my life.</dd><dd> <i>  [Oz pulls a cracker from the box, hoping to change the subject.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Look. Monkey. And he has a little hat. And little pants.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Yeah. I see.</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : The monkey is the only cookie animal that gets to wear clothes, you know that... You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen... So I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sort of ripped? Like, is the hippo going, "hey man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity." And you know the monkey's just, <i>  [in French accent] </i> "I mock you with my monkey pants," then there's a big coup at the zoo...</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : The monkey's French?</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : All monkeys are French.

Does it have to be Ted?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Do you have somebody else in mind? There's a guy out there that would satisfy you?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : My dad? Yeah, okay, that's not gonna happen. Fine, fine, I'll give Ted a chance. I'll play mini-golf, and I'll smile and curtsy and be the dutiful daughter.

Ted[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [about Ted] </i> So far, all I see is someone who supposedly has a good job, and is nice and polite, and my mother really likes him.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : What kind of a monster is he?</dd></dl>

An outfit that you may never buy.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : But I looked good in it.</dd><dd> <b>  Joyce </b> : You looked like a streetwalker.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : But a thin streetwalker. That's probably not gonna be the winning argument, is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Joyce </b> : You're just too young to wear that.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Yeah, and I'm gonna be too young to wear it until I'm too old to wear it.</dd><dd> <b>  Joyce </b> : That's the idea.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Bad Eggs[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Did Mr. Whitmore notice I was tardy?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I think the word you're searching for is absent.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Tardy people show. And yes, he did notice, so he wanted me to give you this. <i>  [hands Buffy an egg] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : As far as punishments go, this is fairly abstract.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : No, it's your baby!</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Okay, I get it even less.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : You know it's the whole sex leads to responsibility thing, which I personally don't get.

A pot of scalding water and about eight minutes.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You boiled your young?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I suppose there is a sort of Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I resent that! Or possibly thank you.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : A little of both might be appropriate.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Bad Eggs[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : So you don't think about the future?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Never?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You really don't care what happens a year from now?

Surprise[2.13]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Buffy tells Angel about her dream, in which Drusilla kills him.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Still, not every dream you have comes true. I mean, what else did you dream last night?

My boyfriend had a bicentennial.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie. Make a move.

Season 2
Surprise[2.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : I'm gonna ask you to go out with me tomorrow night. And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually. It's interesting.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Oh! Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say "yes."</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Yeah, it helps. It ... it creates a comfort zone. ... Do you wanna go out with me tomorrow night?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : <i>  [slaps forehead] </i> Oh! I can't!</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Well, see, I like that you're unpredictable.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Oh ...

Now say pretty please.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Take me instead.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Apparently, you're not familiar with the concept.

<dl><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Hurts, doesn't it?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Well, you know, it kinda <i>  itches </i> a little.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Don't just stand there.

He is clean.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Clean? You mean, he's ...</dd><dd> <b>  Judge </b> : There's no humanity in him.</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : I couldn't have said it better myself.</dd><dd> <b>  Drusilla </b> : Angelus.</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Yeah, baby. I'm back.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : No more of this 'I've got a soul' crap?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : What can I say, hmm? I was going through a phase.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You've really got a yen to hurt this girl, haven't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you just forgive.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Innocence[2.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I knew it! I knew it! Well, not knew it in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn't know. You two were fighting way too much. It's not natural!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I know it's weird ...</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Weird? It's against all laws of God and Man! It's <i>  Cordelia </i> ! Remember? The, the 'We Hate Cordelia Club', of which you are the treasurer.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Look, I was gonna tell you.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Gee, what stopped you? Could it be shame?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : All right, let's over-react, shall we?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : But I'm ...</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Willow. We were just kissing. It doesn't mean that much.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : No. ... It just means you'd rather be with someone you hate, than be with me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Innocence[2.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : What? I took off.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : But you didn't say anything. You just left.</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Yeah. Like I really wanted to stick around after that.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo. Although I guess you proved that last night.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What are you saying?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Let's not make an issue out of it, okay? In fact, let's not talk about it at all. It happened.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I, I don't understand. Was it m-me? Was I not good?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : You were great. Really. I thought you were a pro.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Innocence[2.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : It's not over. I suppose you know that. He'll come after you, particularly. His profile ... he's likely to strike out at the things that made him the most human.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You must be so disappointed in me.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : No. No no, I'm not.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : This is all my fault.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I don't believe it is. Do you want me to wag my finger at you and tell you that you acted rashly? You did. And I can. I know that you loved him. And, he ... he's proven more than once that he loved you. You couldn't have known what would happen. The coming months are, are going to be hard, I suspect on all of us. But if it's guilt you're looking for, Buffy, I'm not your man. All you will get from me is my support. And my respect.</dd></dl>

What guy could resist your wily Willow charms?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : At last count? All of them, maybe more.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well, none of them know a thing! They all get an "F" in Willow.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : But I want Oz to get an "A," and, oh, one of those gold stars!</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phases[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : But I would do a lot better if you and Xander and I could do that "sharing our misery" thing tonight.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Great. I'll give Xander a call. What's his number? Oh, yeah 1-800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Meow!</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Thanks, I haven't gotten a "Meow" before.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phases[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Quite. And it, uh, acts on-on pure instinct. No conscience, uh, uh, predatory and-and aggressive.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : In other words, your typical male.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : On behalf of my gender, hey!</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I didn't jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phases[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [to Willow] </i> Welcome to the mystery that is men. I think it goes something like, they grow body hair, they lose all ability to tell you what they really want.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Phases[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : You mean... you'd still...</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well, I like you. You're nice, and you're funny, and you don't smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf , but that's not <i>  all </i> the time. I mean, three days out of the month, <i>  I'm </i> not much fun to be around either.</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : You are quite the human.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : So I'd still, if you'd still.</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : I'd still. I'd very still!</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Okay. No biting, though.</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Agreed.</dd><dd> <i>  [Willow walks off, then runs back and gives Oz a quick but thorough kiss.

Season 2
Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered[2.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I wish dating was like slaying. You know, simple, direct, stake to the heart, no muss, no fuss.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Sorry to say, Xand, slaying is a tad more perilous than dating.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, you're obviously not dating Cordelia.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered[2.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Dear Buffy. I'm still trying to decide the best way to send my regards.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Why don't you rip her lungs out? It might make an impression.</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Lacks... poetry.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : It doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?</dd><dd> <b>  Drusilla </b> : Don't worry, Spike. Angel always knows...what speaks to a girl's heart.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered[2.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Don't be so jumpy... I've been in your bed before.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah, but Will, we were both in footy pajamas.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Buff, for the love of God, don't open that raincoat.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Come on! It's a party! Aren't you gonna open your present?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : It's not that I don't want to. Sometimes the remote impossible possibility that you might like me was all that sustained me. But not now. Not like this. This isn't real to you, you're only here because of a spell. I mean, if I thought you had one clue what it would mean to me, but you don't, so I can't.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [angered] </i> So you're saying this is all a game?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : A game? I... No!</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You make me feel this way, and then you reject me? What am I, a toy?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Buffy, please calm down.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I'll calm down when you explain yourself!</dd><dd> <b>  Amy </b> : Get away from him.

<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Harmony, shut up. <i>  [Xander looks back] </i> Do you know what you are, Harmony? You're a sheep.</dd><dd> <b>  Harmony </b> : I'm not a sheep.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : You're a sheep. All you ever do is what everyone else does just so you can say you did it first. And here I am, scrambling for your approval, when I'm <i>  way </i> cooler than you are 'cause I'm not a sheep. I do what I wanna do, and I wear what I wanna wear. And you know what? <i>  [Xander smiles] </i> I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date. No matter how lame he is. <i>  [Xander stops smiling] </i></dd></dl>
Season 2
Passion[2.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Passion. It lies in all of us. Sleeping...waiting...and though unwanted...unbidden...it will stir...open its jaws, and howl. It speaks to us...guides us. Passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments. the joy of love...the clarity of hatred...and the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow. Empty rooms, shuttered and dank. Without passion, we'd truly be dead.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passion[2.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Oh, God! I invited him in my car once. That means he can come into my car whenever he wants!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yep, you're doomed to havin' to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they feel like it. And those guys never chip in for gas.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passion[2.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's so weird. Every time something like this happens, my first instinct is still to run to Angel. I can't believe it's the same person. He's completely different from the guy that I knew.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well, sort of, except ...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Except what?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You're still the only thing he thinks about.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passion[2.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I'm sorry, but let's not forget that I hated Angel long before you guys jumped on the bandwagon. So I think I deserve a little something for not saying "I told you so" long before now. And if Giles wants to go after the ... fiend that murdered his girlfriend, I say, " <i>  Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! </i> "</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Yeah. There's just one problem with Giles in a revenge scenario. It'll get him killed.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Passion[2.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Are you insane? We're supposed to <i>  kill </i> the bitch, not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.</dd><dd> <b>  Drusilla </b> : But, Spike, the bad teacher was going to restore Angel's soul.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : What if she did? If you ask me, I find myself preferring the old Buffy-whipped Angelus. This new, improved one is not playing with a full sack. I love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke, but his little pranks will only leave us with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer!</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Don't <i>  worry </i> , Roller Boy. I've got everything under control. <i>  [  Molotov Cocktail  lights the room on fire] </i></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Hey. Here we are. It's all of we. Are we taking me home?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Wilkinson </b> : No. Buffy, you need to lie down, honey.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Yeah? Lie at home. My bed is better than any bed that's... not my bed.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Wilkinson </b> : She's still a little out of it.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Shhh! Hospital zone. No singing.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [Willow brings Buffy, who is in hospital, her homework] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Homework.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : It's my way of saying get well soon.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You know, chocolate says that even better.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I did all your assignments. All you have to do is sign your name.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Chocolate means nothing to me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Killed by Death[2.18]

Season 2
Killed by Death[2.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I'm good at medical stuff, since Xander and I used to play doctor all the time.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : No, she's being literal. She used to have all these medical volumes, and diagnosed me with stuff. I didn't have the heart to tell her she was playing it wrong.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Wrong? Why? How did you play doctor?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I... never have.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Killed by Death[2.18]

I Only Have Eyes for You[2.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Impulsive? Do you remember my ex-boyfriend, the vampire? I slept with him, he lost his soul, now my boyfriend's gone forever, and the demon that wears his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive decision I make will involve my choice of dentures.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Okay, the Angel thing went badly, I'm on board with that, but that's not your fault. And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love can be... nice!</dd></dl>
Season 2
I Only Have Eyes for You[2.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : <i>  [as Angel viciously scrubs his face] </i> You might want to let up. They say when you've drawn blood, you've exfoliated.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What do you know about it? I'm the one who was friggin' violated. You didn't have this thing in you.</dd><dd> <b>  Drusilla </b> : What was it? A demon?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : <i>  [still washing his face] </i> Love!</dd><dd> <b>  Drusilla' </b> : Poor Angel.</dd></dl>
Season 2
I Only Have Eyes for You[2.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Oh, no, no. No. Not cool. This was no wimpy chain rattler. This was "I'm dead as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore."</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Well, despite the Xander-speak, that's a fairly accurate definition of a poltergeist.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I defined something? Accurately? Guess I'm done with the book learning.</dd></dl>
Season 2
I Only Have Eyes for You[2.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I appreciate your thoughts on the matter, in fact I encourage you to always challenge me when you feel it's appropriate; you should never be cowed by authority. Except, of course, in this instance, when I am clearly right and you are clearly wrong.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : <i>  [about the ghost of James] </i> He's-he's trying to... resolve whatever issues are keeping him in limbo. What exactly those are, I'm not...</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : He wants forgiveness.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Yes. I imagine he does. But when James possesses people, they act out exactly what happened that night. So he's experiencing a form of purgatory instead. I mean, he's doomed to kill his Ms. Newman over and over and over again, and... Forgiveness is impossible.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Good. He doesn't deserve it.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's not done because people deserve it, it's done because they need it.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : No. James destroyed the one person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he did what he did. And no matter if he knows now that it was wrong and selfish and stupid, it is just something he's gonna have to live with.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Last month he's the freak with jicama breath who waxes his back. He wins a few meets and suddenly inherits the cool gene?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Well, all I know is, my cheerleading squad wasted a lot of pep on losers.

<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Be quiet. I won't remind you that the fate of the world often lies with the Slayer. What would be the point? Nor shall I remind you that you've jeopardized the lives of all that you hold dear by harboring a known murderer. But sadly, I must remind you that Angel tortured me... for hours... for pleasure.

<dl><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : She wouldn't even kill me. She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head or set me on fire. I mean, is that too much to ask? You know? Some little sign that she cared? It was that truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone soft. Wasn't demon enough for the likes of her. And I told her it didn't mean anything, I was thinking of her the whole time, but she didn't care. So, we got to Brazil, and she was... she was just different. I gave her everything: beautiful jewels, beautiful dresses with beautiful girls in them, but nothing made her happy. And she would fliiirt! I caught her on a park bench, making out with a Chaos demon! Have you ever seen a Chaos demon? They're all slime and antlers. They're disgusting... She only did it to hurt me. So I said, "I'm not putting up with this anymore." And she said, "Fine!" And I said, "Yeah, I've got an unlife, you know!" And then she said... she said we could still be friends. <i>  [leans over and sobs on Willow's shoulder.] </i> God, I'm so unhappy!</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : <i>  [tentatively pats his knee.] </i> There, there.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Lovers Walk
<dl><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : The last time I looked in on you two, you were fighting to the death. Now you're back to making googly-eyes at each other like nothing happened. Makes me want to heave.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I don't know what you're talking about.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Oh, yeah, you're just friends.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : That's right.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You're <i>  not </i> friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love 'til it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 'til it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, children, it's blood -- blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.</dd></dl>

Lovers Walk
<dl><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Oh, sod the spell. Your friends are at the factory. <i>  [Buffy looks at Angel, he shrugs] </i> You know, I'm really glad I came here. I've been all wrong-headed about this. I'm gonna do what I shoulda done in the first place. I'm gonna find Dru, wherever she is, tie her up, torture her, until she likes me again. <i>  [Grins happily] </i> You know, love's a funny thing.</dd></dl>

It was a mistake. But I know that was positively the last time we were <i>  ever </i> gonna kiss.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Darn tootin'!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : And they burst in, rescuing us, without even knocking?

I hope she likes it.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : You're gonna change it back. I'm not afraid of you. Your only power lies in the wishing.</dd><dd> <b>  Anyanka </b> : Wrong! This is the real world now. This is the world we made. Isn't it wonderful?</dd><dd> <i>  [Giles snatches her glowing necklace and breaks free of her grasp, then grabbing a heavy object from his desk, raises his arm to smash the amulet.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Anyanka </b> : You trusting fool.

<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I was a man once.</dd><dd> <b>  The First </b> : And what a man you were.

Season 3
Amends
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : It's not the demon that needs killing in me, Buffy. It's the man.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What about me? I love you so much, and I tried to make you go away. I killed you and it didn't help. And I hate it! I hate that it's so hard ... and that you can hurt me so much. I know everything that you did, because you did it to me. Oh, God! I wish that I wished you dead. I don't. <i>  [whispers] </i> I can't.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Buffy, please. Just this once, let me be strong.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Strong is fighting! It's hard, and it's painful, and it's every day. It's what we have to do. And we can do it together. But if you're too much of a coward for that, then burn. If I can't convince you that you belong in this world, then I don't know what can. But do not expect me to watch. And don't expect me to mourn for you, because ... <i>  [Snow falls, blocking the sunlight.] </i></dd></dl>

I think I'm better than you right now. <i>  [indicates playground shrine] </i> I heard about this. People are talking. People are even talking to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's strange. People die in Sunnydale all the time. I've never seen anything like this.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : They were children. Innocent. It makes a difference.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : And Mr. Sanderson from the bank had it coming? My mom said some things to me about being the Slayer. That it's fruitless. No fruit for Buffy.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : She's wrong.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Is she? Is Sunnydale any better than when I first came here? Okay, so I battle evil. But I don't really <i>  win </i> . The bad just keeps coming back... and getting stronger. Like the kid in the story, the boy that stuck his finger in the duck.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Dike. <i>  [Buffy looks at him.] </i> It's another word for dam.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Oh. Okay, that story makes a lot more sense now.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Buffy, you know there's still things I'm trying to figure out. There's a lot I don't understand. But I do know it's important to keep fighting. I learned that from you.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : But we never...</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : We never win.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Not completely.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Never will.

Gingerbread
<dl><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Uh, wait, wait a minute. Uh... Uh, there is a fringe theory held by a few folklorists that some regional stories have actual, um, very literal antecedents.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : And in some language that's English?</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Fairy tales are real?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Hans and Gre... Hansel and Gretel ?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Wait. Hansel and Gretel? Breadcrumbs, ovens, gingerbread house?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Of course! Well, it makes sense now.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Yeah, it's all falling into place. Of course that place is nowhere near this place.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Some demons thrive by fostering hatred and, and, uh, persecution amongst the mortal animals. Not by, not by destroying men, but by watching men destroy each other. Now, they feed us our darkest fear and turn peaceful communities into vigilantes.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Hansel and Gretel run home to tell everyone about the mean old witch.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : And then she and probably dozens of others are persecuted by a righteous mob. It's happened all throughout history. It happened in Salem, not surprisingly.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm still spinning on this whole <i>  fairy tales are real </i> thing.</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : So what do we do?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go trade my cow in for some beans ... <i>  [silence] </i> No one else is seeing the funny here.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : I came by to tell Buffy to stop all of this craziness and found you all unconscious ... again. How many times have you been knocked out, anyway? I swear, one of these times, you're gonna wake up in a coma.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Wake up in a c...&#160;? Oh, never mind. We need to save Buffy from Hansel and Gretel.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Now, let's be clear. The brain damage happened before I hit you.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [After a vampire rolls down a slide in a playground...] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Wow! That was really funny looking!

Season 3
Helpless
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : You know, maybe we're on the wrong track with the whole spell, curse and whammy thing. Maybe what we should be looking for is something like... Slayer kryptonite .</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Faulty metaphor. Kryptonite kills.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : You're assuming I was talking about the green kryptonite. I was referring, of course, to the red kryptonite, which drains Superman of all his powers.</dd><dd> <b>  Oz </b> : Wrong. The gold kryptonite's the power-sucker. The red kryptonite mutates Superman into some sort of weird --</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Guys, reality!</dd></dl>
Season 3
Helpless
<dl><dd> <i>  [Angel gives Buffy a book for her birthday.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's sweet and thoughtful, and full of neat words to learn and say like "wilt" and "henceforth."</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Then why'd you seem more excited last year when you got a severed arm in a box?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I'm sorry ... it's just, suddenly there's a chance that my calling's a wrong number ... it's just freaking me out a little.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Helpless
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Before I was the Slayer I was ... Well, I- I don't wanna say shallow, but let's say a certain person, who will remain nameless, we'll just call her "Spordelia," looked like a classical philosopher next to me. Angel, if I'm not the slayer, what do I do? What do I have to offer? Why would you like me?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I saw you before you became the slayer.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I watched you, I saw you called, it was a bright afternoon out in front of your school. You walked down the steps and ... I loved you.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Because I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone to see, and I was worried that it would get bruised or torn. And more than anything in my life, I wanted to keep it safe. To warm it with my own.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : That's beautiful ... Or, taken literally, incredibly gross.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I was just thinking that too.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Helpless
<dl><dd> <b>  Kralik </b> : <i>  [to Buffy's mother] </i> Mother. May I call you "mother"? My own mother was a person with no self-respect of her own, so she tried to take mine. Ten years old, she had the scissors. You wouldn't believe what she took with those. But she's dead to me now. Mostly because I killed and ate her, but also because I know I won't be alone much longer. I'll have your daughter. I won't kill her -- I'll just make her like me. Different. She'll go to sleep, and when she wakes up, your face will be the first thing she eats. <i>  [considers] </i> I have a problem with mothers. I'm aware of that.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Zeppo
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Xander, one of these days, you're gonna get yourself hurt.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Or killed.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Or both. And you know, with the pain and then the death, maybe you shouldn't be leaping into the fray like that. Maybe you should be fray-adjacent.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Excuse me? Who, at a crucial moment, distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Yeah. That was real manly, how you shrieked and all.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I think you'll find that was more of a bellow.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Zeppo
<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : It must be really hard when all your friends have, like, superpowers. Slayer, werewolf, witches, vampires, and you're, like, this little nothing. You must feel like Jimmy Olsen .</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I happen to be an integral part of that group. I happen to have a lot to offer.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Oh, please.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I do!</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Integral part of the group? Xander, you're the-the <i>  useless </i> part of the group. You're the Zeppo . "Cool." Look it up. It's something that a sub-literate that's repeated twelfth grade three times has, and you don't.</dd><dd> <i>  [Cordelia turns and walks away.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : <i>  [to herself] </i> There was no part of that that wasn't fun.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Zeppo
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Do you remember the demon that almost got out the night I died?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Every nightmare I have that doesn't revolve around academic failure or public nudity is about that thing. In fact, once ... I dreamt that it attacked me while I was late for a test and naked.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Zeppo
<dl><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : She got me really wound up. A fight like that and, no kill. I'm about ready to pop!</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Really? Pop?!</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : You up for it?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Oh, I'm up. I'm suddenly <i>  very </i> up. It's just, um, I've never been up with people before.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Just relax. And take your pants off.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Those two ... concepts are ... antithetical.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Don't worry. I'll steer you around the curves.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Did I mention that I'm having a very strange night?</dd></dl>

Dumb guy. Little bomb. How hard can it be?</dd><dd> <i>  [Jack, leader of the zombie gang, knocks him to the floor] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : And it just got harder.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I'm not leaving 'til that thing's disarmed.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Then I guess you're not leaving. I'm gonna carve you up and serve you with gravy. You piss me off, boy. Now you pay the price. First the eyes, then the tongue. I'm gonna break every one of your fingers.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : You gonna do all that in forty-nine seconds?</dd><dd> <i>  [Jack looks at the bomb's clock, then the door, then Xander.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I know what you're thinking. Can I get by him? Get up the stairs, out of the building, seconds ticking away. I don't love your chances.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Then you'll die, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah, looks like. So I guess the question really is: Who has less fear?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : I'm not afraid to die. I'm already <i>  dead </i> .</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Yeah, but this is different. Being blown up isn't walking-around-and-drinking-with-your-buddies dead. It's little-pieces-being-swept-up-by-a-janitor dead, and I don't think you're ready for that.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : <i>  [tired smile] </i> I like the quiet.</dd></dl>

No, Mr. Giles has checked my credentials ... rather thoroughly, phoned the Council. But I'm glad to see you're on the ball as well. A good Slayer is a cautious Slayer.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Is he evil?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Not in the strictest sense.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : I missed the mark last night and I'm sorry about the guy, I really am! But it happens! Anyways, how many people do you think we've saved by now? Thousands? And didn't you stop the world from ending? Because in my book, that puts you and me in the plus column.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : We help people! It doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Why not? The guy I offed was no Gandhi. I mean, we just saw he was mixed up in dirty dealings.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Maybe, but what if he was coming to us for help?</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : What if he was? You're still not seeing the big picture, B. Something made us different. We're warriors. We're built to kill.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : To kill demons! But it does <i>  not </i> mean that we get to pass judgment on people like we're better than everybody else!</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : We <i>  are </i> better!</dd></dl>

Season 3
Enemies
<dl><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : And you say this demon wanted cash? That's very unusual.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Demons after money. Whatever happened to the still beating heart of a virgin? No one has any standards anymore.</dd></dl>

Well, actually, let's just say I applied some pressure. Or more accurately, that I asked politely. And then... Okay, I bribed him.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : How much?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Twenty-eight bucks.

Season 3
Enemies
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I know this. It's down by the bus station. Not the nicest part of town.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Again. See, no standards. I mean, any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Enemies
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : You know how some people hate to say I told you so? Not me. I told you so. Angel's back in the really bad sense, and um, I told you so.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Angelus has turned? Xander, this is terribly serious. Are you sure?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Gee, let me think. Kind of hard to tell. Last thing I remember was his fist.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : We must contact Giles immediately.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Good thinking. Let's waste time with a lively debate. Leave Buffy alone, and see how dead she gets.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Slow down, Xander. This isn't Wesley's fault.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Actually, it is. Faith was your responsibility. Guess who's Angel's new playmate?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Faith and Angel? Together?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Imagine the possibilities.</dd></dl>

Earshot
<dl><dd> <i>  [after Buffy begins to hear people's thoughts] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : And Buffy, be careful with this gift.

But we are. Journeys end. And what is a journey? Is it just.. distance travelled? Time spent? No. It's what happens on the way, it's the things that shape you.

Nothing will ever be the same. Nothing.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <b>  Mayor Wilkins </b> : It has begun. My destiny. It's a little sooner than I expected. I had this whole section on civic pride.

<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [about college] </i> It's nice that you're excited.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : It's just that in High School, knowledge was pretty much frowned upon, you really had to work to learn anything.

So I ended up washing dishes at the fabulous "Ladies Night" club for about a month and a half while I tried to pay for the repairs. Nobody really bothered me, or even spoke to me, until one night, when one of the male strippers called in sick, and no power on this earth will make me tell you the rest of that story. Suffice to say, I traded my car in for one that wasn't <i>  entirely </i> made of rust, came trundling back home to the loving arms of my parents, where everything is exactly as it was, except I sleep in the basement and I have to pay rent.

<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You know, for someone who teaches human behavior, you might try showing some.</dd><dd> <b>  Professor Walsh </b> : It's not my job to coddle my students.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You're right. A human being in pain has nothing to do with your job. <i>  [exits] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Professor Walsh </b> : I like her.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Initiative
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : OK, say that I help and you start a conversation. It goes great. You like Buffy, she likes you. You spend time together, feelings grow deeper and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're in love. Time stops and it feels like the whole world's made for you two and you two alone, until the day one of you leaves and rips the still-beating heart from the other, who's now a broken, hollow mockery of the human condition.</dd><dd> <b>  Riley </b> : <i>  [taken aback] </i> Yep, that's the plan.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I figured it was.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [Willow is trying to help Riley get together with Buffy] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Talk, funny is good but don't be glib. And remember, if you hurt her I will beat you to death with a shovel. A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend. Have fun!</dd></dl>

The Initiative
<dl><dd> <i>  [Spike, having tricked Willow into inviting him into her dorm room, prepares to attack her.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I'll give you a choice. Now I'm going to kill you - no choice in that. But I can let you stay dead... or bring you back, to be like me.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> <i>  [frightened] </i> : I'll scream!</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Bonus. <i>  [moves toward Willow's neck] </i></dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> <i>  [A short time later, Spike sits on Willow's bed, confused and disconsolate. Willow still cowers from him.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I don't understand. This sort of thing's never happened to me before.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> <i>  [timidly trying to offer comfort] </i> : Maybe you were nervous.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I felt all right when I started.

The Initiative
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, how about this: we whip out the Ouija board, light a few candles, summon some ancient unstoppable evil? Mayhem, mayhem, mayhem; we show up and and kick its ass.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> <i>  [pauses to contemplate] </i> : A wee bit unethical.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Pangs
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Thanksgiving isn't a-about <i>  blending </i> of two cultures. It's about one culture wiping out another! A-and then they make animated specials about the part where... w-with the maize and th-the big, big belt buckles. They don't show you the next scene, where... where all the bison die, a-and Squanto takes a musketball in the stomach!</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Okay, now, for some of that, you were channeling your mother?</dd></dl>
Season 4
Pangs
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : With Mom at Aunt Darlene's this year, I'm not getting a Thanksgiving. Maybe it's just as well.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : Well, I think that's a shame. I love a ritual sacrifice.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's not really a one of those.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : To commemorate a past event, you kill and eat an animal. It's a ritual sacrifice... with pie.</dd></dl>

Pangs
<dl><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : I inflicted a lot of putrefying diseases on men when I was an avenging demon, you look like you're getting all of them.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Okay, I'll stay. But you should go, you could catch it.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : We'll die together. It's romantic... Help me get your trousers off.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : You're a strange girlfriend.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : I'm a girlfriend?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Oh, there's a chance I'm delirious.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : Ah, yes.

All right? You came in and you killed them and you took their land. That's what conquering nations do. That's what Caesar did, and he's not going around saying, "I came, I conquered, I felt really bad about it." The history of the world is not people making friends. You had better weapons, and you massacred them. End of story.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well, I think the Spaniards actually did a lot of-- Not that I don't like Spaniards.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Listen to you. How you gonna fight anyone with that attitude?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : We don't wanna fight anyone.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I just wanna have Thanksgiving.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Heh. Yeah...Good luck.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : If we could talk to him--</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You exterminated his race. What could you possibly say that would make him feel better? It's kill or be killed here. Take your bloody pick.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Maybe it's the syphilis talking, but... some of that made sense.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I made a lot of these points earlier, but fine, no one listens to me.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Pangs
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I'll never get used to this. One day, she's at the friendship ceremony. The next day, she's on the news. The coroner's office said she was missing an ear. So I'm thinking, maybe we're looking for a witch. There's some great spells that work much better with an ear in the mix.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : That's one fun little hobby you've got there, Will.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Or... or maybe an ear-harvesting demon that--it's, like, building another demon completely out of ears. Or... ooh! Thought. We're just assuming someone else cut off the ear. What if it was self-inflicted, like <i>  Van Gogh </i> ?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : So... she brutally stabs herself, dumped the body, then cut off her own ear?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : No. She cut off her ear, then killed herself, then dumped the body--I'm really off my game, aren't I?</dd></dl>

All you care about is lots of orgasms.</dd><dd> <i>  [The others are silent with disbelief.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : OK... remember how we talked about private conversations?

It was carved into his chest, like a big creepy eye.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : It's kind of like the CBS logo.

<dl><dd> <b>  Professor Walsh </b> : It's only our methods that differ; we use the latest in scientific technology and state of the art weaponry and you, if I understand correctly, poke them with a sharp stick.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Er, its more effective then it sounds-</dd><dd> <b>  Maggie Walsh </b> : Oh, I'm - quite sure of that. As I'm just as sure that we can learn much from each other. I'm working on getting you clearance into the Initiative, I think you'll find the results of our operation most impressive.

They always do that in movies.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : This is the Initiative, Xander. Military people don't make out with science people.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Maybe that's what's wrong with the world. You ever think about that?</dd></dl>

Goodbye Iowa
<dl><dd> <i>  [Buffy, Willow, and Anya are watching Road Runner in bed in Xander's Basement] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : That would never happen.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Well no, Buff. That's why they're called cartoons not documentaries.</dd></dl>

Goodbye Iowa

Season 4
Goodbye Iowa
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [about Adam] </i> I could barely fight him. It was like Maggie designed him to be the ultimate warrior. He's smart and fast, he gave the commando guys the slip with no problem.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : There's gotta be a flaw.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I think the part where he's pure evil and kills randomly was an oversight.</dd></dl>

So that's my dream, that and some stuff about cigars and tunnel. But uh tell me college girl, what does it mean?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy: </b> To me.

Sooner or later you're gonna have to face it. She was over us a long time ago, Joyce. <i>  [voice rising to a shout] </i> Too busy climbing onto her new boy toy to give a single thought to the people that matter!

I mean, I could be rich, I could be famous. I could have anything. Anyone. Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up. I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of. I could squeeze you until you pop like warm champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more.

<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : The coven, they're the most amazing women I've ever met, but there's this look they get, like I'm going to turn them all into bangers and mash.

I'm sure you can understand that.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : I don't have that much power, I don't think.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : It's all connected.

More than flesh.</dd><dd> <b>  The First </b> <i>  [as  <b>   Glory  </b>  ] </i> : More than blood. I'm... you know, I honestly don't think there's a human word fabulous enough for me.

And that's where we're going, ...</dd><dd> <b>  The First </b> <i>  [as the  <b>   Master  </b>  ] </i> : ...right back to the beginning! Not the Bang. Not the Word. The true beginning.

<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : It's simple. Spike follows the smell of Willow and we follow the fairly ripe smell of Spike.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : It's smellementary.

It could take like ten strokes to knock the nail in. Power, control. It's a trade off.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : That's actually not a bad analogy.

And that's <i>  us </i> . Any questions?</dd></dl>

Bring on the Night
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : <i>  [to Buffy] </i> Are you sure this thing called itself The First?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before anything else.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : Please, how many times have I heard that line in my demon days? "I'm so rotten, they don't even have a word for it. I'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny?" <i>  [everyone stares at her] </i> Or terrified. Whatever.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [To the Potential Slayers.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : We need to stick together, okay? We're stronger that way. We cannot afford to fall apart now.</dd><dd> <b>  Andrew </b> : She's right.

Season 7
Showtime
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Last time I tried using magic... the First, it turned it around on me, got inside. I felt it surging through me, every fibre of my being, pure undiluted evil. I could taste it.</dd><dd> <b>  Kennedy </b> : How's evil taste?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : A little chalky.</dd></dl>

Season 7
Potential
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen. To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night. I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : Maybe that's your power.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : Seeing, knowing.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Maybe it is...

Season 7
The Killer in Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I know. But you should go. This trip is important for the girls, to understand the source of their power, and know how to use it right.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : I don't think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking. It's frightening and it's difficult. Then, apparently someone told them that the vision quest consists of me driving them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey.. until a spooky rasta mama slayer arrives and speaks to them in riddles.</dd></dl>
Season 7
The Killer in Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Kennedy </b> : Let's start with the easy stuff. How long have you known... that you were gay?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Wait. That's easy? And what, you just assume that I'm gay. I mean, presume much?</dd><dd> <b>  Kennedy </b> : Okay, sorry. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Hey! What, you think you have some sort of special lesbo-dar or something?</dd><dd> <b>  Kennedy </b> : Okay, you know there's a better word for that, right?</dd></dl>
Season 7
The Killer in Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Soldier </b> : Miss Summers! Agent Finn reported that you tried to contact him earlier today.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I knew it! <i>  [whispers to Spike] </i> Government conspiracy.</dd><dd> <b>  Soldier </b> : He indicated you might be needing our assistance. We're to provide you anything you need to help Ass-Face here.</dd><dd> <i>  [Spike and Buffy stare at him.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Soldier </b> : Those were <i>  his </i> exact words, ma'am.</dd></dl>
Season 7
First Date
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You think I'm losing sight of the big picture, but I'm not. When Spike had that chip, it was like having him in a muzzle. It was wrong. You can't beat evil by doing evil. I know that.</dd></dl>
Season 7
First Date
<dl><dd> <b>  Lissa </b> : I can't even figure out if I've got the right kind of rope.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : That depends on what you need it for. Something like functional around the house, or, you know, recreational -- by which I mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing -- not for tying someone up for sexy, funky fun... In conclusion, rope can be useful in various ways.</dd></dl>
Season 7
First Date
<dl><dd> <b>  Robin </b> : Well, then, I'd, um, I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all right with you. I mean, you don't have to. I'm certainly not saying come to dinner if you enjoy having a job. <i>  [chuckles] </i> You know, I may have to make up a document saying I didn't just say that and have you sign it.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Sure. I'd be happy to have dinner with you.</dd><dd> <b>  Robin </b> : Great. I'll draw up the paperwork.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I should move out. Leave town before it is time for me.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : No, you have to stay.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You've got another demon fighter now.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : That's not why I need you here.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Is that right? Why's that, then?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Because I'm not ready for you not to be here.</dd></dl>

Yeah. Oh, nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter, safer stuff. Uh, if Kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. See you inside. <i>  [to Buffy] </i> So much cooler than Snyder!</dd><dd> <b>  Wood </b> : <i>  [when Willow left] </i> She really almost destroyed the world?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Yep.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Get It Done
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Oh I don't know. It's just... The First is coming... and look at us, the army! We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Get It Done
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, yeah, but only because you kinda told us to. You're our leader, Buffy, as in "follow the".</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well, from now on, I'm your leader as in "do what I say".</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Jawohl. But let's not try to forget, we're also your friends.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : I'm not.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Then why are you here?

Season 7
Lies My Parents Told Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [about the school] </i> Situation still normal. Well, or as normal as this school ever sees.</dd><dd> <b>  Robin </b> : So it appears.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Well, no fires, no one's heads going kablooey. And the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Lies My Parents Told Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Maybe you're right. Maybe everything is fine.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Giles, what's wrong?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Have you seen the new library? There's nothing but computers. There's not a book to be seen. I - I don't know where to begin, Buffy. I mean, who do we speak to?</dd><dd> <b>  Robin </b> : Uh, that would - that would be me. Hi. I'm Robin Wood.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Oh, sorry. Rupert Giles. Sorry. Buffy tells me you're something of a freelance demon fighter. <i>  [Robin closes door] </i> Oh, yes, yes. I, um, I'm relieved. We're running dangerously low on allies.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : So, we didn't stop it, then?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain the First is continuing to gather its forces. I'm afraid war is inevitable. <i>  [regarding the library] </i> So, we should go before the school board.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Lies My Parents Told Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Kennedy </b> : So, Spike's trigger's been active this entire time?</dd><dd> <b>  Rona </b> : How can Buffy take this for granted? I mean, he lives in our house, we train with him.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : Don't waste your time down that road. Spike's got some sort of "Get Out of Jail Free" card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. I mean, he could slaughter a hundred frat boys, and... <i>  [everyone shoots a look at Anya] </i> Forgiveness makes us human, blah-dee-blah-blah-blah.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Lies My Parents Told Me
<dl><dd> <b>  Andrew </b> : Willow, a call for you from L.A. Somebody named Fred . The guy sounds kind of effeminate.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Dirty Girls
<dl><dd> <b>  Caleb </b> : "Drink of this, for it is my blood." You know, I always loved the story of the Last Supper. The body and blood of Christ becoming rich, red wine. I recall, as a boy, though, I couldn't help but think: what would happen if you were at the Last Supper, and you ordered the white? A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin. I mean, would he make that out of his lymph or some-all? Never did bring it up. Suppose there was a reason why I never spent too long in one parish. Just looking for answers. Just looking for the Lord in the wrong damn places. Then you showed me the light.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Dirty Girls
<dl><dd> <b>  Caleb </b> : <i>  [to Faith] </i> Well, you're the other one, aren't you. You're Cain to her Abel. No offense meant to Cain, of course.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : I never was one for the good book.</dd><dd> <b>  Caleb </b> : Oh, it has its moments.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Empty Places
<dl><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : I might need a parrot.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Well, to go with the eyepatch, to really complete the look. I think I still have that costume from Halloween.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. Maybe the hospital can hook you up with a nice one. Maybe they have a two-body-parts-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch "Jaws 3-D" again.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Empty Places
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [about Caleb] </i> Still able to make me see cartoon birdies all around my head? You betcha. The short lack of consciousness was nice. I feel rested.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Touched
<dl><dd> <b>  Kennedy </b> : All I'm saying is now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how and when we lose our necks.</dd><dd> <b>  Robin </b> : Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about the "losing of the necks" bit.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : Let the girl speak the truth. We're all on death's door, repeatedly ringing the doorbell, like maniacal Girl Scouts trying to make quota.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Touched
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : We were never close. You just wanted me because I was... unattainable.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You think that's all that was?</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Please, let's not go over the past.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : Oh, no, no! Oh, let's hold on here! I've hummed along to your pity ditty. I think I should have the mic for a bit.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You're insufferable.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Thank you. That really helped.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I'm not tryin' to cheer you up.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Then what are you trying to say?</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I don't know! I'll know when I'm done sayin' it. Something pissed me off, and I just-- "unattainable," that's it.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Fine. I'm attainable. I'm a-- I'm an "attain-a-thon." May I please just go to sleep?</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You listen to me. I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I prefer you didn't. Don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker. I follow my blood... which doesn't exactly rush in the direction of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes. A lot of wrong bloody calls. A hundred-plus years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of. You... Hey, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say I love you, it's not because I want you, or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you <i>  are </i> . What you do. How you try. I've seen your kindness, and your strength. I've seen the best and the worst of you, and I understand, with perfect clarity, exactly what you are. You're a <i>  hell </i> of a woman. You're the One, Buffy.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I don't want to be the One.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : I don't want to be this good-looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Touched
<dl><dd> <b>  Robin </b> : That's exactly what The First does. Finds your Achilles' heel .</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Nah, it just talked to me. What? It does a heel thing, too?</dd><dd> <b>  Robin </b> : It's a phrase. Your weak spot.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Oh. The school thing. I was kind of absent that decade.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Touched
<dl><dd> <b>  The First  (as Buffy) </b> : I envy them. Isn't that the strangest thing?</dd><dd> <b>  Caleb </b> : Well, it does throw me just a tad. I mean, they're barely more than animals. Feedin' off each other's flesh, it's nauseatin'. But you, you're everywhere. You're in the hearts of little children. You're in the souls of the rich. You're the fire that makes people kill and hate. The fire that will cure the world of weakness. They're just sinners. You are sin.</dd><dd> <b>  The First  (as Buffy) </b> : I do enjoy your sermons.</dd><dd> <b>  Caleb </b> : And you're in me. Gave me strength no man can have.</dd><dd> <b>  The First  (as Buffy) </b> : You're the only man strong enough to BE my vessel and I know you feel me, but... I know why they grab at each other. To feel. I want to feel. I want to wrap my hands around some innocent neck and feel it crack.</dd><dd> <b>  Caleb </b> : Amen.</dd></dl>
Season 7
End of Days
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : I think it's maybe some kind of scythe. The only thing I know for sure is that it made Caleb back off in a hurry.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : <i>  [to Giles] </i> So it's true. Scythe matters.</dd></dl>
Season 7
End of Days
<dl><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : There's only supposed to be one. Maybe that's why you and I can never get along. We're not supposed to exist together.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Also, you went evil and were killing people.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Good point. Also a factor.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : But you're right. I mean, like... I guess everyone's alone, but... being a Slayer? There's a burden we can't share.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : And no one else can feel it... Thank God we're hot chicks with superpowers.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Takes the edge off.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : <i>  [nods] </i> Comforting.</dd></dl>
Season 7
End of Days
<dl><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : And they have no purpose that unites them, so they just drift around, blundering through life until they die, which they-they <i>  know </i> is coming, yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, which is <i>  clearly </i> insane... and yet here's the thing. When it's something that really matters, they fight. I mean, they're <i>  lame morons </i> for fighting, but they do! They never... they never quit. So I guess I'll keep fighting too.</dd><dd> <b>  Andrew </b> : That was kind of beautiful. You, you love humans.</dd><dd> <b>  Anya </b> : I do not.</dd><dd> <b>  Andrew </b> : Yes you do. <i>  [singing] </i> You <i>  love </i> them.</dd></dl>
Season 7
End of Days
<dl><dd> <b>  Guardian </b> : One way or another, it can only mean an end is truly near.</dd><dd> <b>  Caleb </b> : I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that last part, on account of her neck snapping and all. Did she say the end is near, or here?</dd></dl>
Season 7
Chosen
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : <i>  [about Spike] </i> It's different. He's different. He has a soul now... What?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : That's great! Everyone's got a soul now.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : He'll make a difference.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You know, I started it. The whole having-a-soul. Before it was... all the cool new thing.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : Oh my god, are you <i>  twelve </i> ?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I'm getting the brush-off for Captain Peroxide. It doesn't necessarily bring out the champion in me.</dd><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : You're not getting the brush off. Are you just gonna come here and go all Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Aha! <i>  [points] </i> Boyfriend!</dd></dl>
Season 7
Chosen
<dl><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : This goes beyond anything I've ever done. It's a total loss of control, and not in a nice, wholesome, my-girlfriend-has-a-pierced-tongue kind of way.</dd></dl>
Season 7
Chosen
<dl><dd> <b>  Buffy </b> : So here's the part where you make a choice. What if you could have that power, now? In every generation, one Slayer is born, because a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. <i>  [points to Willow] </i> This woman... is more powerful than all of them combined. <i>  [Willow whimpers] </i> So I say we change the rule. I say my power... should be <i>  our </i> power. Tomorrow, Willow will use the essence of the Scythe to change our destiny. From now on, every girl in the world who <i>  might </i> be a Slayer, <i>  will </i> be a Slayer. Every girl who <i>  could </i> have the power, <i>  will </i> have the power, <i>  can </i> stand up, <i>  will </i> stand up. Slayers... every one of us. Make your choice. Are you ready to be strong?</dd><dd> <b>  Vi </b> : These guys are toast.</dd></dl>

I can feel them, Buffy. All over. Slayers are awakening everywhere.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : We'll have to find them.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : We will.</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : Yes, because the mall was actually <i>  in </i> Sunnydale, so there's no hope of going there tomorrow.</dd><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : We destroyed the mall? I fought on the wrong side.</dd><dd> <b>  Xander </b> : All those shops, gone. The Gap, Starbucks, Toys 'R' Us... Who will remember all those landmarks unless we tell the world of them?</dd><dd> <b>  Giles </b> : We have a lot of work ahead of us.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Can I push him in?</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : You've got my vote.</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : I just want to sleep, yo, for like a week!</dd><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : I guess we all could. If we wanted to.</dd><dd> <b>  Willow </b> : Yeah! The First is scrunched, so, what do you think we should do, Buffy?</dd><dd> <b>  Faith </b> : Yeah, you're not the one and only Chosen anymore. Just gotta live like a person. How's that feel?</dd><dd> <b>  Dawn </b> : Yeah, Buffy. What <i>  are </i> we going to do now?</dd><dd> <i>  [Buffy begins to flash a happy smile] </i></dd></dl>
