So I did.</dd><dd> <b>  Dorothy </b> : Blanche, why is this a story about acceptance?</dd><dd> <b>  Blanche </b> : Oh - because years later, to get back at me, Cathy Lee slept with my daddy! That was something I had to accept. Mama accepted it too - along with a brand new Cadillac Eldorado for her birthday. You know, my family had a few dollars, and I loved them dearly, but when you get right down to it, basically they were trash.</dd></dl>

It was mid-century, and a disillusioned Italy looked to the House of Savoy for leadership. Giuseppe Garibaldi , our courageous leader - and not a bad dresser - thought, "Let's regain some national pride and jump into this Crimean War thing."

Sick and Tired[5.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Rose </b> : You know, there are all sorts of things that people get that they can't diagnose, and then they disappear as mysteriously as they came. Gustav Lundqvist got sick from something mysterious, and he nearly died - well, he <i>  did </i> die, in fact. Then at the cemetery, Beatrice Lundqvist, his wife, kept screaming, "He's alive! He's alive! I can hear it from the grave!" Well, everyone thought it was the hallucinations of a grieving widow, so they sedated her. But when she woke up from her sedation, she told them that he had said from the grave, "We never paid our '78 through '86 income taxes!" And his partner said, "Only Gustav would know that! He must be alive!" So, they all raced to the cemetery, and the entire town started digging like crazy, kneeling by the grave, using their hands even, dirt flying and Beatrice screaming. And when they opened that coffin, there he was... dead as a doornail.</dd><dd> <b>  Blanche </b> : What is the point of that ridiculous story, Rose?!</dd><dd> <b>  Rose </b> : The point is, Gustav didn't die from his mysterious disease at all! He lived and recovered. The trouble is, he recovered while he was buried, so by the time they got to him, he'd died of suffocation.</dd><dd> <b>  Blanche </b> : I just don't believe these stories you tell, Rose!</dd><dd> <b>  Rose </b> : Another tragic aspect was, the IRS was waiting at the cemetery to arrest Gustav's partner, Bergstrom. So, Bergstrom killed himself right then and there, by grabbing the gun from Sheriff Tokqvist and shooting himself. What they did then was, since the grave was still open, and everyone was right there, and Gustav and Bergstrom had been partners, so they put Bergstrom in with Gustav and had a double burial. Unfortunately, later they found out that Bergstrom wanted to be cremated.</dd><dd> <b>  Blanche </b> : Oh... shut up, Rose!!!</dd></dl>

Somebody else was writing this.</dd><dd> <b>  Rose </b> : Who?</dd><dd> <b>  Blanche </b> : Every man. This is every man's work. It's all gold. Just open it anywhere, the magic will touch you.

I was made because he always made new friends more easily than I did. And I'm mad today, because <i>  [voice breaks slightly] </i> I never wanted to give the eulogy at my kid brother's funeral. I'm mad because he died, he didn't have the wisdom to know that family members shouldn't allow themselves to grow apart, because when this day comes, they can no longer tell each other how much they care. If he'd had that wisdom, he could've shared it with me and I would've known the hundreds of memories I have of just the two of us, eating ice cream on the stoop of our building, or going through the drawers at Grandma's house, or dressing up like the Bronte sisters.
