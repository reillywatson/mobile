Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God, watching everything, you know? With a plan for us and stuff. I don't know man, but it keeps me up at night.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : What? I mean why are we out here, in this canyon?</dd><dd> <b>  Grif </b> : Oh. Uhhhhh.

No way in or out.</dd><dd> <b>  Grif </b> : Uh huh.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : I mean, the only reason that we set up a red base here is because they have a blue base over there. And the only reason they have a blue base over there is because we have a red base here.</dd><dd> <b>  Grif </b> : Yeah, that's because we're fighting each other.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : No, no, but I mean... even if we were to pull out today, and they were to come and take our base, they would have <i>  two </i> bases in the middle of a box canyon.

It takes a while to figure out the difference. Like this green, <i>  [points to Church's head] </i> indicates a high level of anger stemming from suppressed feelings of inadequacy.</dd><dd> <b>  Church </b> : If that thing keeps talking bad about me, I'm gonna fucking smash it.</dd><dd> <b>  Doc </b> : <i>  [points to Church's crotch] </i> And this green means impotency.

He's got a lot of energy since his first feeding!</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> Tucker...fed...the baby. Gross.</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> Actually, Caboose was kind enough to donate some blood. You know what they say: "it takes a village."</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> How'd you get him to agree to <i>  that? </i></dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> It's amazing what you can get Caboose to do when you promise him a cookie and a glass of orange juice.</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> But he hates needles.</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> No needles. Turns out, if you just expose some bare skin, the little guy just digs right in! It's a miracle to see nature at work!</dd><dd> <b>  Caboose: </b> ( <i>  drunkenly </i> ) I feel dizzy...</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> Uh, is he gonna be okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> Tucker's kid drank half a gallon in one go.

That'd be crazy.</dd><dd> <b>  Caboose: </b> ( <i>  looking around randomly </i> ) Oooooh...</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> Anyway, blood is pretty important, so Caboose is bound to have some side effects like dizziness, or nausea, or sensitivity to light -</dd><dd> <b>  Caboose: </b> I think I'm going to stop standing up now... <i>  (collapses face-down on the floor </i> )</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> Or passing out.</dd><dd> <b>  Caboose: </b> ( <i>  from floor </i> ) Church, if I die, I want you to have my orange juice...</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> How can Tucker sleep with all that racket?</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> Sleeping? He's not sleeping, he's in a coma.</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> Alright, that's it. Get out of the way Doc, I'll take care of this.</dd><dd> <b>  Caboose </b> : ( <i>  from floor </i> ) I can't feel my torso...</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> I don't think so. A newborn is really susceptible to infection, and disease, and <i>  cuddling! </i> I want to expose it to as few people as possible.</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> Doc, don't worry, I'm not going to give it a cold. I'm going to go in there, step on its neck, and shoot it in the head. 'Cause that's how I roll.</dd><dd> <b>  Doc: </b> Well now you're <i>  definitely </i> not coming in.

Poor Donut, I'll miss him like a sister</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : I'll miss him like, well, like someone I knew, but then I don't really want to reflect on how deep our relationship went.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : Wait a second, do you hear that? Sounds like tapping.</dd><dd> <b>  Grif </b> : All I hear is you guys talking about your feelings for Donut. And I have to say, I'm not really comfortable with that.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : Listen, there it is again.</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : You're absolutely right. That sounds like Morris Code.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : Um, excuse me sir. It's actually not Morris Code, it's Morse code, sir.</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : Morse, haha, that sounds ridiculous, I don't think so.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : Yes. Morse is the person who developed an international code for communicating without audio, Morris was a television cat that sold cat food.</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : And that cat was one of our finest military minds. Don't you see, that mean Donut is alive and trying to contact us.. Now, get to tappin'.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : Maybe we can lift the ship off him somehow.</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : Great idea, Simmons! I've read reports that people can get enormous strength in stressful situations. There was woman that lifted a car off her baby.</dd><dd> <b>  Grif </b> : You want me to call Donut's mother?</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : Don't make me angry Grif, <i>  you wouldn't like me when I'm angry. </i> Now if there was only some way to tap into our inner rage...like that Hulk fella. Doggonnit, there's never any Gamma Radiation around when you need it.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : What if we try getting into the ship, and lowering the landing gear? That might raise the ship.</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : Or we could build an army of clones that could lift the ship.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : I think the jack in the warthog might be able to lift it.</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : We could develop a machine that shrinks the ship, or that makes Donut gigantic, or both.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : Or we could try digging underneath the hull.</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : I've got it! A levitation ray! I think I have a spare in the base! I'll be right back.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons </b> : But sir!</dd><dd> <b>  Sarge </b> : Simmons this is no time to chat about your crackpot theories! I'll get the levitation ray!

It's the outside of the base, inside's on the inside, you go through that door right there, to the inside. Um, there's a ramp over here. There's another one on the other side. It's kinda smaller. Does the same thing, though. Uh, it's got a basement. There's a middle part and there's a top part. Got some, you know, blue flags here... on the outside. Those come in handy when... you're trying to identify the color of the base. It's blue. Anyway, that pretty much covers the base. So, anyway, uh, that's it.</dd><dd> <b>  Sister: </b> Cool.</dd><dd> <b>  Church: </b> I'm Church. I'm the leader. Everybody looks up to me. Pretty much the only rule for rookies on the blue team is don't kill the leader.

Why would I be afraid of bats? And why would you even ask that question? Were there bats or something?

I think he fell through that hole into the cavern.</dd><dd> <b>  Grif: </b> Maybe he just disappeared. Dead things do that when you bury them. That's part of the circle of life, you know. It's a miracle when you think about it. No reason to go randomly exploring caves which may or may not contain hundreds of evil bats. That would just be interfering with God's divine plan!</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons: </b> Okay, A: Sarge wasn't dead. B: Decomposing takes months, not minutes. C: His armor would still be here, and D: Shut up, you're going down there. NOW.</dd><dd> <b>  Grif: </b> Why? What do we really need Sarge for anyway? All he ever did was yell at us a bunch and tell us we suck. We'll just split up his duties. You yell at me and I'll tell you you suck.</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons: </b> Shut up and get in the hole, Grif!</dd><dd> <b>  Grif: </b> You suck, Simmons. Oh man, this new system is already working out great! We should have thought of this years ago!</dd><dd> <b>  Simmons: </b> Grif, don't you understand that because we lost Sister, we're horribly outnumbered? We already lost Donut and Sarge.

I just went along with orders and hoped that everything would work out for me. But after all that's happened, you know what I've learned? It's not about hating the guy on the other side because someone told you to. I mean, you should hate someone because they're an asshole or a pervert or a snob, or they're lazy or arrogant or an idiot or a know-it-all. Those are reasons to dislike somebody. You don't hate a person because someone told you to; you have to despise people on a personal level, not because they're red or because they're blue, but because you know them and you see them every single day, and you can't stand them because they're a complete and total fucking douchebag.</dd><dd> <b>  Caboose </b> : ...I meant, why are we out here in the sun when we could be standing down there in the shade?</dd><dd> <b>  Church </b> : Oh.
