<dl><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : You want to know how big my balls are? My balls are bigger than two of your heads duct-taped together. I've been in the middle of shit that would make you piss your pants right now. Uptown, downtown, Harlem, Brooklyn. But there ain't no medals on my chest, assholes, 'cause I ain't no hero. I'm a fireman. We're not in the business of making heros here. We're in the business of discovering cowards, 'cause that's what you are if you can't take the heat. You're a pussy, and there ain't no room for pussies in the FDNY. <i>  [to a snickering recruit in the first row] </i> What are you laughing at, shithead? Huh?

Because I have seen it all. I knew sixty men who gave their lives at Ground Zero. Sixty. Four of them from my house. Vito Castella... found him almost whole. Ricky Davis... found him almost whole, hugging a civilian woman. Bobby Vincent... found his head. And my cousin, Jimmy Keefe, my best friend. You know what they found of him? What I was able to bring back and give to his parents? A finger. That's all. A finger. These four men were better human beings and better firefighters than any of you will ever be.</dd><dd> <b>  Firefighting Class Instructor </b> : Say "thank you," firefighting upper class!</dd><dd> <b>  Firefighting Upper Class </b> : Thank you, Firefighter Gavin, sir!</dd></dl>

I was on the girl's softball team in college and I never called any of those women a twat. You know why? Because every woman I've ever met finds that word offensive. Not as offensive as the other word but in a race you know, they're like neck and neck.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Yeah, but now you work in a job with men. A highly-populated job by men, so now you gotta cut the men you work with a little slack.</dd><dd> <b>  Mike </b> : I thought the word that women hated most was the "C" word.</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : Yeah.

Where are the black guys callin' white people crackers, huh? Where were the Mexicans shittin' all over the Puerto Ricans? You know? Where were all the chinks who hate the Japs, who hate the Koreans who hate-- <i>  [Don trys to interrupt him but Tommy keeps going] </i> This is bullshit. This is just to cover the FDNY's ass, that's all this is good for. Just in case some Puerto Rican woman or some fat Chinese guy files a lawsuit against the FDNY or God help us there's another disgruntled female firefighter who thinks she has a case. The FDNY can say "No, no, no, they can't be prejudice, they took this horseshit sensitivity training." Let me tell you somethin' the next time I run into a burning building and refuse to bring out anybody who's not the same color as me, then that's when you can bring my angry, pink, sober, Irish, ass back down here.

Your dick is not a weapon of mass destruction because if it were I would be in complete awe of you, which I am not. But there are really two issues here Sean. The first pertains to the fact that you have a tiny fragment of brain matter lodged somewhere in your skull. No offense.</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : None taken.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Second is your dating pool. Which in my opinion, should be drained, filled in, and black topped over.

Those Beatles songs that you used to sing to her to make her fall asleep. Those sweet little horse-clown pictures that you used to draw for Katy. (Janet starts crying) You know Tommy, I couldn't even move for almost a day, and then I couldn't stop crying. I need my kids. But at least three or four times a day when I had them Connor and Katy would look at me and ask where you were. "Is Daddy coming for the weekend?" "Is Daddy coming for Christmas." "Where's Daddy now?" "Is Daddy dead, you would tell us if Daddy died, right mom?" I was in a hospital for a couple of weeks. But I uh got some counseling. And I got back up on my feet. The thing is while I was there, I got my head straightened out enough that I got a little perspective. I think for the sake of the kids, and from what we used to be like, before Jimmy died. I think we oughta give it one last go.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : One last go?

Like, your brain is wired directly to your penis, okay? So, you have all these inputs and outputs and if you put the wrong input in the wrong output, next thing y'know your brain is sending the wrong signal to your dick and you can get completely screwed up, okay? So it's okay now when you're 18 years old and you're bangin' a hot 38 year old Mrs. Turbody-- but then you can turn into a 45 year old man-- my age, and then all of a sudden you wanna bang... 70 year old broads, okay? You want that, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Damian </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : You ever seen your grandmother naked?</dd><dd> <b>  Damian </b> : Hell no.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Well, I'm talkin' about seein' her and wantin' to bang her.

In a room full of self-involved, young titless little chicks, she's a woman, okay? A real woman. Probably a very witty and wonderful woman...</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : With a great rack.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : The rack was secondary, okay? It doesn't matter now. But the point being, I can't go over there and talk to her now.</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : But why, why not?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Because even if I went over to talk to her and got her to come home with me somehow, and got her to reveal the afore-mentioned great rack, all I would be thinking about is your mom's rack, and how great your mom's rack is. Not that I ever thought of your mom's rack before, but that's all I can think of now! Your mom's rack!</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : Hey, woah.

I'm the perfect guy for you right now. I know, I know, I know. I mean, all these years I've been talking about Janet about how crazy she is and how illogical and nonsensical, and how she... never ever is gonna be satisfied with everything.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : It turns out I was right. Yeah, but it's not just her. It's pretty much all woman. That's what I-- Yeah, but the problem is, I was approaching it the wrong way, yeah. I was thinking about you know, me and sex-- By the way, the sex thing is the key... sex really has nothing to do with marriage. Tits, ass, sex... just throw that out the window. The key stuff is... listening. You gotta be able to listen, and have long conversations that-- that you remember, um... hugging.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : Hugging?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Yeah, hugging's a big one. Buying furniture. And what's the other one? Oh, spooning. Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : Okay. Now, let me get this straight: You, Tommy Gavin, one of the all-time, hall of fame type, pussy hounds in the history of the FDNY, in my opinion, you are tellin' me that I should forget about ass, forget about tits, forget about sex and focus on... uh... caring and sharing and listening and... hugging, and uh...</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Spooning.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : Right. I mean, this what's making your marriage work?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Yep. That and the fact that my dick doesn't apparently work with any other women. <i>  [sighs] </i> It really sucks. But, you know, if I were you, I'd pull the trigger as fast I can, pal. Get yourself hitched.</dd></dl>

She did everything for me, you know, guys. And I never even thanked her. I mean, I thanked her, like you know, I said 'thanks, mom', but they were just words.

I mean, come on.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : You know why? You know why you don't get it? Because you're young and the future is your friend, you know, and your eyes work and your cocks work, and the way you guys think you're gonna be on the job forever, and it don't work that way, boys.</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : Okay, so if I get a little older, a little sick, I should just kill myself? Is that what I'm supposed to do?</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : You know what? It was Jerry's life and he was unhappy and he made a choice. And obviously it was a pretty severe choice, but you wanna know somethin'? I give the guy all the respect I have for going out on his own terms.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : Yeah, well, I don't. I think he was a goddamn coward.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Watch it, Franco.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : I'm just sayin' how I feel, Lou.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : <i>  [to Tommy]' Do you hear this shit? </i></dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Yeah, except that I kinda agree with him.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Well, then screw you, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Well, he was a coward. He was afraid. Afraid of workin' behind that desk down at down at headquarters for the next five or--</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : Oh, come on, Tom. That's your excuse--</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Shut up, asshole! What do you got eight years on the job? (Sean goes to say something) Shut up! Christ almighty. You know how much he hated being the Chief, huh? Watching us run into jobs while he stood outside, but he did it. You know why? So he could teach assholes like, (points to Sean and Franco) you and you what the job was really about. When he was working up in the Bronx, when the Bronx was burning, huh? You ever hear about those days, huh? They'd get 10, 12, 14 jobs a night! Shithead. He ran into a job up on 279th street, he pulled three kids in wheelchairs out in somethin' like 15 minutes. You know why? Because the rest of his crew was busy bringing old people out. There was an old storage warehouse fire up there one night and the Chief on the job that night shut the job down because it was 'too hot for humans'. You know what Jerry did? He ran around the side of the building, went in the side door, pulled out two drunken assholes, ends up the two same assholes who started the goddamn fire! And he was working then, without a mask, running in and out of the building with a cigar danglin' out of his mouth. You wanna talk about being brave and who's a coward and who's not a coward? Suck my cock. You wanna talk about brave? When he was workin' up in the Bronx, he used up all the goddamn brave he had.</dd></dl>

I'm just sayin' what they're sayin.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Or how about 'God doesn't really give a shit about poor black kid's fire', how about that name, huh? It's unbelievible to me, it really is. What was God thinkin' here, Mick? What do you think? What did he have in mind?</dd><dd> <b>  Mickey </b> : We don't know. Maybe he was showin' his mercy, maybe he was savin' these kids from a fate far worse down the line somewhere. Either way, it's out of our hands.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Well, lemme tell 'ya somethin', okay? We carried those goddamn kids out in our goddamn hands because their moron parents plugged in faulty space heaters because they were tryin' to keep warm, 'cause their shit-ass landlords were too cheap to keep the goddamn heat on. God had nothin' to do with it, okay? God doesn't even venture into the equation, okay? But according to your theory, I guess God had Connor run over by a drunk driver, why? So he can spare him the fate, of maybe having cancer of the ass when he was 42 years old? Is that what's goin' on, Mick?</dd><dd> <b>  Mickey </b> : Or maybe because of his DNA he becomes a raging alcoholic and gets behind the wheel with a load on and runs over somebody else's innocent kid 15 years from now.

Parents are supposed to die before their kids, that was one of the things that was so screwed up about 9/11, y'know? All these guys... doin' the right thing, and dyin', parents havin' to bury 'em. It's not right. Besides, I'm sure your mom was a pain in the ass half the time anyways, half the time she probably called 'ya, you probably looked at your phone, and left it to go to voice mail, right? Because you didn't wanna talk to her. ... As much as I love my wife, same thing, man. Sometimes, y'know, we separate, arrange a schedule so y'know, we didn't have to see each other, except in passing at a couple weeks at a time, and then you see 'em for a coupla hours and you start to get all those great feelings back... and a couple days later, you hate 'em again. But at least she died before you did, 'cause I'll tell 'ya what, there's nothin' worse than burying your kid. I did it, y'know? ...

I'll never forget when my Aunt Bridy said, she said 'I'm 77 years old, I don't have enough time.' It's the truth. I could live to be 106, I'm not gonna get over Connor. And he was a real pain in the ass that morning, he was ridin' that bike, in between cars, I was tryin' to fix the truck... but I got two healthy kids... and of all I've said about my wife, she's been a great mother, y'know?

Lemme ask you this, can she sing?</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : How the hell do I know?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Well, I'm just askin' because sometimes a talent in one area can overcome or take the edge off a lack of talent in the other area.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Did I also mention that she's fat?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Oh, she's fat?

Its a series of long, mind boggling boring stretches of time where absolutely nothing happens. So, anything can happen. Then, next to a little while, when that crisp crack bat hitting the ball, so crisp you can almost smell the wood burning. Jolts you awake and you open your eyes to see something so exciting and intricate. Possibly very, very meaningful has just happened. But you missed it because you were just so god damn bored in the first place. Couple hot dogs, throw in some beers, the occasional blow job and that's that.</dd></dl>

It's a vicious cycle, Mike. Not to mention, that they're never gonna find a cure, 'cause there isn't one. Cancer is God's disease, it's his way of thinning out the herd.

<dl><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : <i>  [about his dad] </i> Teddy, his was 82, okay--</dd><dd> <b>  Teddy </b> : What are you puttin' time limits on people now? Shut your mouth. Just because it's okay for you, doesn't mean it's goddamn okay for the rest of us.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Who says it's okay for me?</dd><dd> <b>  Teddy </b> : I seen 'ya, I seen 'ya at the funeral. I'm up there cryin' my eyes out like a bitch and you're sitting there like a goddamn stone. And then all that shit you said the other night after we watched the movies? You make me sick just to look at you. You're glad he's gone, you're glad because now you don't have to look at the kind of man that you'd never be.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : <i>  [about his hearing] </i> You know guys, I'm sure you're aware, if this doesn't go my way, which I'm sure it won't, they're gonna put me on immediate light duty and the odds are that I'm not gonna be comin' back to the firehouse. I just wanted to say--</dd><dd> <i>  Mike, Sean, Franco' </i> : <i>  [at the same time] </i> Nah, nah, Tommy. We feel that same way. It's been an honor working with you.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Lemme just get this out of the way, and say it out loud, as firefighters, it's like a football team, y'know our pluses and minuses balanced out and we made a great team, we really did. And I felt really safe working with you guys, and you saved my ass many times and vice versa. But... you know, I felt blessed, and the other thing that I wanted to say... <i>  [they all tell him he doesn't have to] </i> Lemme just say this stuff, very quickly because it needs to be said, in case the guy that comes in and stands in my shoes doesn't put it out on the table, I'll do it for him. Number 1, you're a moron. <i>  [points to Sean] </i> Don't argue with me, because you proved it in spades when you married my goddamn sister, okay? <i>  [Mike laughs] </i> What are you laughin' about? Because if he's a moron, you're the king of the morons. Don't gimme the look... Do me a favor, spell 'moron'.</dd><dd> <b>  Mike </b> : Okay, spell what? <i>  [they laugh] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Franco, I really, wished you weren't the guy who laughed the hardest at that because, if you took one iota of energy that you spend everyday chasin' pussy and you put into somethin' good, like I don't know, helpin' man kind, I'm pretty sure at this point we'da stitched up the whole in the ozone layers, there'd be no more wars, and this party would be in a bar by owned by you and the planet Neptune. <i>  [to Black Shawn] </i> You, can't really say too much about you, because I don't know well enough and it wouldn't be fair to judge you. But, life's unfair, so lemme get it out of the way, you probably suck, too. <i>  [points to Lou] </i> And this, my best friend, who is not only a loser with women and a giant slob, but a goddamn lush. <i>  [Lou nods] </i> Case closed. So what does that say about me? Good luck, guys. See 'ya later.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : <i>  [about Colleen and Shawn waiting to have sex] </i> She's not gettin' married, I'm tellin' you that. How did we go wrong? We purposefully raised her the wrong way, as a lapsed Catholic so now she enjoying herself on birth control, bangin' her brains out, but now she wants to reclaim her virginity and wait to have sex 'til she gets married. My daughter turned Amish on me, how's that possible? She's not gettin' married, she's not gonna end up like her mom, I'm tellin' 'ya.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Wh- What do you mean? Gorgeous, 40, and angry? She's Irish, she's gonna end up angry no matter what.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : She's not gettin' married, I'm tellin' 'ya. Too young!</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Tommy, you keep that act up, she's gonna get married even sooner.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : I'm gonna tell 'ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna talk to her, have a conversation with her, and she's gonna end up having sex with him, okay? She's gonna have lots of sex with him, she's gonna have so much sex, that it's gonna turn into what sex is supposed to be: Boring, monotonous chore, just like it is for everyone else who's in a long-term relationship, and then he's gonna get bored, and then he's gonna leave, and then we're all set, and the marriage is off.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Right. So lemme get this start, you're gonna have a conversation with your teenage daughter, telling her to have sex with her boyfriend?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Yes, I am.</dd><dd> <b>  Lou </b> : Can I sit in on that conversation? Because it's gonna be so creepy, it's gonna reset the high end of my creep-meter for the rest of my life.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Mike </b> : You know, uh, Frank, I got this Uncle out in Staten Island and he owns this company, they transport hazard waste. I was gonna work for him, but a couple days before, 9/11 happened. And uh, I watched the news, and I saw all the people postin' flyers around town lookin' for their loved one's, and I just really felt, like I'm sure everybody did, that I had to do something, y'know. ... So, I decided to become a firefighter. You know, how a lot of kids wanna be firemen when they get older, well, I wanted to be a superhero. Even after, I knew that they really didn't exist, I still wanted to be one, because I wanted to fight the bad guys, you know. Frank, what I'm tryin' to say is... that I became a firefighter because of the bad guys did on 9/11, and if you're tellin' me that there are other bad guys and that their our leaders, our people, the people who are supposed to watchin' out fo everybody, that's too scary. I can't even think about that. I mean, I understand that there's evil in this world, but I just feel a lot better if it comes from some place that I don't call home.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : Yeah. ... You say you were gonna take up transporting hazardous waste?</dd><dd> <b>  Mike </b> : Yeah, I was gonna be a driver.</dd><dd> <b>  Franco </b> : Jesus. I never thought I'd say this, but thank God for 9/11. <i>  [they laugh] </i></dd></dl>

I mean, I think we've raised you kids with that color, creed, religion, you know... none of that stuff, you know, doesn't matter to us. And... you know, love, it's a big thing... it's... you know, it-- it, it just happens. And I think it's kinda important to... you know... What?</dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : What's the problem?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : There's no problem, honey, I just wanna... okay... If you were gonna buy a car, you'd test drive it, that's what I'm tryin' to say.</dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : Oh, my God.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : No, no, listen. If you were gonna test drive a car, you'd take it out and you'd drive it around, and you'd maybe take it on the highway...</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : <i>  [walks up] </i> : Hey, Col, how are 'ya? You're gonna buy a car so I hear? Y'know my friend, Mark, is gettin' rid of this old--</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Y'know, she's all set, she's got a car. That's nice though. Thanks. <i>  [Sean walks off, Tommy continues his thought before Sean interrupted] </i> Listen, I just think you know, it's important that the parts... fit.</dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : What parts?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : You know the parts, and don't make me say the parts, you--</dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : His penis in my vagina.</dd><dd> <b>  Sean </b> : <i>  [overhearing] </i> : You guys aren't talkin' about cars, are you? <i>  [Tommy makes a face, and Sean walks off] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : Are you actually tellin' me to have sex with Shawn?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : No... kinda... yeah. I'm just sayin' that I don't think it's such a bad idea for you to do it, okay? You don't have to do the whole thing... just y'know, do the Clinton thing, you don't have to go all the way--</dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : Oh, my God!</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Honey, what? I thought that would be easier.</dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : Dad! Dad, are you tellin' me to-- Oh, my God.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : I'm not tellin' you anything, what? What? It's a suggestion, I'm suggesting some stuff to help you with your--</dd><dd> <b>  Colleen </b> : I'm telling mom.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Black Shawn </b> : Hey, Tommy? Did you tell Colleen to go down on me?</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Black Shawn </b> : She said you said somethin' about Bill Clinton. ... I just find that shit, very, very disturbing.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : I didn't say anything like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Black Shawn </b> : Now, here I am a good brother, tryin' to keep it real, and here you are tellin' her to go down on me, and service me in an oral fashion.</dd><dd> <b>  Tommy </b> : Wh-what?
