// REV. LOVEJOY

"Rev. Lovejoy: Thanks a lot, Marge. That was our only burlesque house.",

"Rev. Lovejoy: Get a divorce.<p>Helen Lovejoy: Mmm-hmm.<p>Marge: But isn't that a sin?<p>Rev. Lovejoy: Marge, just about everything is a sin. (Holds up a Bible) You ever sat down and read this thing? Technically, we're not allowed to go to the bathroom.",
"Rev. Lovejoy: Eventually I stopped caring, but that was the 80's so nobody noticed.",

"Rev. Lovejoy: While I have no opinion for or against your sinful lifestyles, I cannot marry two people of the same sex no more than I can put a hamburger on a hotdog bun. Now, go back to working behind the scenes at every facet of entertainment!",
"Rev. Lovejoy: Once something has been approved by the Government, It's no longer immoral.",
"Rev. Lovejoy: Judgement Day is upon us. I warned you the Lord wouldn't stand for your minidresses and Beatle boots. But it's not too late to repent your sins and be embraced by the Almighty!",

"Rev. Lovejoy: This so called new religion is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and chants designed to take away the money of fools. Let us say the Lord's prayer 40 times, but first let's pass the collection plate.",
"Rev. Lovejoy: Alright Hans, time to go.<p>Hans Moleman: But he ate my last meal!<p>Rev. Lovejoy: If that's the worst thing that happens to you today consider yourself lucky.",

"Principal Skinner: So, what's the word down at one School Board Plaza?<p>Superintendent Chalmers: We're dropping the geography requirement. The children weren't testing well. It's proving to be an embarrassment.<p>Principal Skinner: Very good. Back to the three R's.<p>Superintendent Chalmers: Two R's, come October.",
"Superintendent Chalmers: You have got to end this thing, Seymour.<p>Principal Skinner: We're not coming down until our jobs are reinstated and you acknowledge and celebrate our love.<p>Superintendent Chalmers: Seymour, no one would like to celebrate your love more than I, but I'm a public servant. I'm not permitted to use my own judgement in any way.<p>Mrs. Krabappel: (Taking phone) Then let us take our case directly to the townspeople.<p>Superintendent Chalmers: Oh, yeah, that'll be real productive.

"Superintendent Chalmers: Religion has no place in public schools the way facts have no place in organized religion.",

One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere. Like the time I took the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So, I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now to ride the ferry cost a nickel, but in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. 'Gimme five bees for a quarter,' you'd say. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. The important thing was, I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war.
