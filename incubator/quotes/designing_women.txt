Old Spouses Never Die [1.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Dr. Mitchell, I'm Julia Sugarbaker. May I come in?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : Yes, but I hope this won't take long. I'm on the staff of three hospitals, and I still have rounds.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Oh, I understand how very very busy you are, and I'll be brief. I've come because I'm a very close friend of Charlene Frazier's.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : Charlene Frazier is no longer my patient, so I can't see....</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Actually I'm not here only for Charlene's behalf, but on behalf of all your patients.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : I don't understand.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : What I'd like to know is, how many more women are you gonna kill before you retire?!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : I beg your pardon?!</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : You see, I've done a little checking on you, Dr. Mitchell, and I've discovered that Charlene is not the first woman you've told to wait and see. You said the same thing to another close friend of mine, only at that time I didn't know that you were her physician. Well she trusted you. She waited four months before her breasts had become so misshapen she had to come back, but by then it was too late.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : Mrs. Sugarbaker, I don't think I would care to discuss with you medical judgments which you know nothing about.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Medical jargon doesn't impress me. I was brought up in a medical family, and my grandfather always said 80% was common sense. There's nothing mysterious about having a lump in your breast. It's simple, when you find one you have it x-rayed or biopsied. I know that. Most physicians know that. What I don't understand is, why don't you know that?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : (arrogantly) Perhaps I'm of the old school.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : (furiously) That's not "old school"! That's gross <i>  incompetence </i> !!!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : Well, it's obvious to me that you are an emotional, overwrought woman.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Not emotional, Doctor, I'm just plain mad. Which is why I'm filing charges against you with the state medical bureau and the AMA.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Mitchell </b> : Well, if you want to make a fool of yourself, be my guest, but I can assure you you're in no way qualified to make these judgments. I think this meeting is over.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I think so too, but as for qualified, neither are you. You don't depend on medicine. Your weapon is intimidation. You're a seemingly kind, benevolent authority figure who tells women to let you do their worrying for them. Well there's just one thing wrong with that, Dr. Mitchell; you don't have to do their dying!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Monette [1.13]
<dl><dd> <i>  [As the ladies wait for Charlene's friend in her foyer, a gentleman comes in circling Julia.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Gentleman </b> : I was just wondering...

In a few more hours they'll be talking kidnapping.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : I wish I'd never met her. She thinks I'm wonderful. She even loves my cooking.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : You don't cook.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well, I know that, but she doesn't! Li Sing's the first person who's ever loved me just for me.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : She's not the first. She's the third.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : What? you mean my ex-husbands?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : No, silly. Mother and me. We love you just for you.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Yeah, but you don't think I can do anything.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : That's not true. I just said I didn't think you were cut out to be a mother.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : You mean unlike the four billion other women on Earth? Thanks a lot.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : But you do something nobody else can do.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I don't know what it is.....exactly.....that you do. I just know nobody else is doing it, or can do it, like you do. You giving away your pillow?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Yeah. I wanted Li Sing to have it.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I think Grandma would like that. I remember when she made these for us. Roots and Wings. We sure got our share didn't we? Suzanne, I'm going to say something pretty harsh, but I'm saying it because I love you. Just once in your life, don't put yourself first.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : I'm not, Julia. I'm thinking of Li Sing.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : No, you're not. You're not thinking at all. You know, in your heart, that she's better off with this couple. If you love her, like you say you do, give her wings.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : I just didn't expect to fall in love with her. I know, you're right. I know. Ok, I'll do it.</dd><dd> <i>  [Julia takes Suzanne's hand and starts to cry herself.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I'm so happy for you.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Because, now. . . you know what it feels like to be a mother.</dd></dl>

They said what they always say.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Well I know, but just out of curiosity, what was it?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : All right, Charlene.

He wouldn't even know you were there.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : But I would. I can't stand to think about him dying with strangers. That's the way it happened with Hayden. (sobbing) They wouldn't let me be with him, and he was calling for me!</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Julia, listen to me. I know how you feel about that. That's why I told the doctor that if at any time it looks like Reese isn't gonna make it, they're to come out here and get you.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : You did?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene and Mary Jo </b> : You did?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Yes, I did.

Thank you for doing that. (crying and hugging Suzanne)</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : We're just gonna sit down here together, and you rest your head on my shoulder okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : (to Mary Jo) It's amazing, isn't it?

Cruising [2.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : A couple of hoods got after Julia.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Hoods love Julia.

They said the same asinine things they always say.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : I know, but just out of curiosity what was it?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Charlene, we always go through this. Why do you have to know?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : I don't know. It's a sickness.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : All right, Charlene. If you must know, they said, "Hey Sweet Meat. What it is.

<dl><dd> <i>  [The firm gets a job redecorating a cruise ship.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well, you can count me out. I'm not going on any singles cruise. And I'm certainly not interested in putting up with a bunch of dorky men in bad toupees and polyester suits.</dd></dl>

Number two, that I'm not seated next to Club Mel at breakfast. And number three, I was thanking God that I did not grow up with a mother who wore a leopard skin headband, white see-through t-shirt and glued rhinestones to her fingernails.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Cruising [2.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Mary Jo, what on Earth is the matter now?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : It's this stupid dress of Suzanne's. This is so typical. It's just like her to hang this by my bed so it won't get wrinkled in the closet. As if I'm so little it won't bother me. She does this kind of thing to me all the time.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Why don't you just take it down?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : Actually, this fascinates me. These bra cups are huge.

Especially by somebody who is too dumb to appreciate a woman like Suzanne Sugarbaker. Just who do you think that you're talking about? This is no two-bit singles cruise barnacle. This is the Rolls Royce of females who happens to have more beauty titles than you have teeth. And let me tell you something else, I consider it an honor just to guard her brassiere and I am not even a man.</dd></dl>
Season 2
I'll Be Seeing You [2.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well, all I have to say is, the next time Olivia May gets sick, you all can just invite somebody else to play cards. I don't like this game. I like simple games.

My poor parents had to mail order hippopotamus steaks. I'm not kidding, y'know. Until they finally figured out I could have stuff like squirrel and rabbit and 'coon, y'know. Sometimes they even fed me 'coon for breakfast...</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [After being trapped in the hotel room all night:] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I think this illness has affected your brain.

Where have you been, Charlene? I mean that's what we're doing here.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Suzanne, his name is not Wilson Pickett, it's Wilson Brickett. Wilson Pickett's a black singer.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Okay, so I was close.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : How do you figure you were close, because they're both black? You might as well have said Don King.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Who's Don King?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Who's Don King?! You don't know who he is either?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Oh yeah, I know who he is. He's that guy who sings "Tiny Bubbles."</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : "Tiny Bubbles"?! Suzanne, Don King does not sing "Tiny Bubbles," that's Don Ho! (to Julia) She just does this to drive me insane. It's like we're the Smothers brothers, and she's Tommy and I'm Dick.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : <i>  (walks in with a tray) </i> What is the matter?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Oh, I don't know, Mary Jo, it's just Charlene.

And I'm not any red-necked deer hunter. I'm a professional man who's simply interested in protecting his family.</dd><dd> <b>  Brickett </b> : Amen.</dd><dd> <b>  Newscaster </b> : Mrs. Sugarbaker?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Facts are: number 1: a seven day waiting period does not prohibit anyone from obtaining a gun, unless he or she happens to have a criminal record.</dd><dd> <b>  Brickett </b> : Mrs. Sugarbaker, you're a smart gal and a pretty one too. When you go out at night alone, I bet you carry some kind of little handgun in your purse. How would you feel if you were robbed and raped during that seven day period while you waited for approval for that handgun?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Well, Commissioner, I'd probably feel as badly as you would feel if you were molested and shot by someone who'd just gotten out of prison and bought a gun on that very same day.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Caller </b> : My children attend school here in Atlanta, and I do not appreciate Commissioner Brickett's lack of support for our extra curricular fine arts programs like dance and ballet.</dd><dd> <b>  Brickett </b> : Listen. When the petticoat sports can attract a gate that pays for itself like basketball and football, then I'll get excited. Anyway, I think we should spend less time worrying about the screwball curriculums and get back to the basic three R's.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Screwball curriculums?! Petticoat sports?! I bet you think Refrigerator Perry is a better athlete than Mikhail Baryshnikov! I mean, I don't know what kind of an ignoramus...</dd><dd> <b>  Anthony </b> : (clears his throat)... ahem!!</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : (immediately turning to the camera and smiling) I strongly support a more expanded program of liberal arts in the public schools and would do my best to encourage funding.</dd></dl>

By the way, you may be interested to know that flag sales in this country are at an all-time high.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I think the Pledge of Allegiance is wonderful, and so is the flag. You know, it's not an official American document. It was taken from a children's magazine.</dd><dd> <b>  Newscaster </b> : Yes, but should reciting it be mandatory?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : No, it should be a privilege.</dd></dl>

Tyrone [3.09]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Suzanne enters, obviously distraught.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : <i>  [(whimpers)] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Something wrong, Suzanne?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Yes, something is wrong. I'm driving down the street this morning, the sun is shining, I'm young, I'm beautiful. I look in the rearview mirror and what do I see? There is a hair growing out of my chin. I mean, have you ever in all your life? I simply could not believe my eyes. Here I am, hardly 30 years old, and there's this hair sticking out right here. It's unbelievable. Obviously, I'm being punished for some heinous sin, like telling Kyle Westheimer's parents that he is, in fact, a bisexual. But all I know is, whatever it is, I did not merit this.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : You told some guy's parents that he's a bisexual?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : That's right. I always tell the parents. And I'm not sorry either. I don't believe in bisexuals. I figure the rest of us have to choose, so why shouldn't they?</dd></dl>
Season 3
Tyrone [3.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : <i>  (leaning her chin in toward Julia) </i> Julia, do you see anything else there?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : No, Suzanne, I don't.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Good. Cause if I get another one, I'm just gonna have to get a gun and shoot myself through the head.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : Why don't you shoot yourself in the chin? Maybe that way you'll hit the root.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : I'm glad you all find this so amusing.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Oh c'mon, Suzanne. Don't you think you're being just a little bit shallow?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : No, I do not Charlene. I don't think it is shallow not to want to go through life wearing a goatee.</dd></dl>

Tyrone [3.09]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Anthony is going over spelling words with Tyone.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Anthony </b> : Cantaloupe.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : C-A-N-T-A-L-O-U-P-E</dd><dd> <b>  Anthony </b> : That's very good, Suzanne.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : <i>  (beaming) </i> I eat it all the time.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Junies [3.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : They've got a hold of Charlene and they're not letting go. This is not a business organization, it's some kind of cult. Some kind of perky cult. Let's face it. Charlene's been kidnapped by the Junies.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Junies [3.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : No offense, Julia, but if this Libby person is as bad as you say, you are way out of your league. I know these kind of women. They'll kiss you and call you honey and slop sugar all over you while all the time they're just thinking about themselves. I mean, that terminator stuff doesn't work with them. You gotta fight sugar with sugar. They'll find that's a job for professionals.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Junies [3.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : No, Suzanne, we do not think that is silly. The idea of a nice college homecoming queen ceremony, where you yourself would be rooting for a 30 year old black man, seems not only logical, but very dignified.</dd></dl>
Season 3
One Sees, the Other Doesn't [3.13]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Suzanne says she doesn't want to date a blind man.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : We're talkin' about a millionaire who spends his weekends with under-privileged kids. I mean, we're talkin' about a Phi Beta Kappa from Vanderbilt who still knows why Hee-Haw is funny. I mean, men like that are just not walking the streets.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well, that's good. Because men like that would be bumping into each other.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Odell [3.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Oh, it was just one of Charlene's brothers again. What's his name there? Odell. He's probably just wanting to catch her up on the hillbilly news, like they got 'em a new scarecrow or something like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : You know, Suzanne, I don't like that word "hillbilly." Just because Charlene comes from a big family and they live on a farm, doesn't mean they sit around like Mammy and Pappy Yokum, smokin' corn cob pipes and drinkin' moonshine.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well, I'm sorry Julia, but I don't think it's in good taste to have that many children. Unless of course, you're Mormon.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : What does that have to do with it?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : I don't know, they just seem to handle it better. They form those singin' groups, stuff like that.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Odell [3.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Oh, for Pete's sake. Every time you two get a little cranky, you start going on these man bashing jags, you know? "Men are the cause of all trouble in the world. Men invented high heels and cheap panty hose." I bet you next thing you know, you'll be accusing them of that whatchamacallit, that PMS envy.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : PMS envy? I swear, somebody from the Geraldo Rivera show ought to follow you around with a tape recorder.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Odell [3.14]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Discussing Charlene's little brother:] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Let me get this straight. He's never had a girlfriend, he knits sweaters and he works at the beauty shop?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Well, he goes to Three Rivers Junior College, too. What are you gettin' at?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well, I don't mean to get personal Charlene, but has it ever occurred to you that maybe Odell is involved in some homosexual activity?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Suzanne! I mean, just because a person is sensitive and artistic doesn't mean he's gay. Not that that would matter to me anyway.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Well I think he sounds like an interesting and talented young man.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : I think he sounds like a woman.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : Bear in mind that this comes from the lips of a woman who thought there was a patron saint for homosexuals named, "Saint Francis of a Sissy."</dd></dl>
Season 3
Full Moon [3.15]
<dl><dd> <i>  [After Julia returns from a fashion show where her dress got caught up in her pantyhose:] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I can't believe that all my life, I've tried to create some semblance of grace and style. Now I'm going to be remembered as that woman...</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : ... who mooned Atlanta.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Full Moon [3.15]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Charlene and Mary Jo relate an embarrassing story to try to cheer Julia up.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Suzanne, don't you have a most humiliating story to tell?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Yes, I do. My most humiliating moment... was when Julia mooned 1200 people.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Engagement [3.17]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Mary Jo drags Julia to a keg party for moral support as she breaks off with her younger boyfriend, Kenny. As Julia returns from the powder room she runs into Kenny.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Kenny </b> : Mrs. Sugarbaker! How 'bout you and I going out sometime? I bet I could pick up a thing or two from you.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Well, I doubt that, Kenny. But I might be able to offer you one piece of wisdom.</dd><dd> <b>  Kenny </b> : Oh yeah? What's that?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : I believe that you will find as years go by, and you get older and wiser, traversing life's little ups and downs, that underwear probably really doesn't make all that good of a hat. <i>  (turning to Mary Jo and speaking loudly to be heard over the music) </i> The powder room isn't really functional now. The keg is in the bathtub and it seems the tap is slow. This is a source of some concern for all the young men in there because they are trying to fill Craig's funnel. Craig, it seems, drinks his beer out of a funnel.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Engagement [3.17]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Charlene tracks Julia down by phone for advice on handling her fiance's snooty family, who thinks she has no class . . . Julia continues in her loud voice in order to hear herself.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Where the heck are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : If you must know, Charlene, I'm at a keg party.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Julia! I can't imagine you at a keg party! I mean . . . y'know, you have so much class.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : That's just the point, Charlene. If you have class, you have it. It doesn't matter where you are or who you're with . . . and I have to go now because Craig is getting ready to drink out of the funnel.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Engagement [3.17]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Charlene has a heart-to-heart with Bill's mother.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : I love your son with all my heart, and I'll do anything to make him happy. But as much as I want to fit into his family, I'm just as proud of the one I come from.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Women of Atlanta [3.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Anthony </b> : Suzanne, if you want one of my cookies, why don't you just ask?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Why should I do that for? I've been getting as many as I want without asking.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Don't try to reason with her, Anthony. Suzanne does not understand the concept of fairness. She only understands punishment and reward. If you don't want her to eat anymore of your cookies, I suggest you put a little mousetrap in there. Let it snap on her hand once, I guarantee she'll get the point.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Women of Atlanta [3.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well all I'm saying is this better not turn out to be any kind of cheesecake, cause I just don't do cheesecake. I eat it, but I don't do it.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Stand and Fight [3.20]
<dl><dd> <b>  Anthony </b> : What would you do if somebody was coming after you?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Scream for help.</dd><dd> <b>  Anthony </b> : Uh, uh. You can't depend on anybody helping you.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Then I'd run away.</dd><dd> <b>  Anthony </b> : You can't always get away.</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Well, then, I'd kill them with a rolled up magazine. I saw this thing on TV where spies learn how to kill somebody with a rolled up magazine.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Stand and Fight [3.20]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Suzanne wants to practice her self-defense course lessons:] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Suzanne, why are you so interested in this course now? I mean, you didn't even want to go the first time. Now every time I see you it's, "Charlene threaten me, Charlene come at me with a knife, Charlene mug me at the Ready Teller."</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Okay, Julia, come on. Come at me with a knife. I dare you.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Suzanne, I appreciate your enthusiasm for our anti-mugging course, and I must admit that occasionally this week I have enjoyed choking you, but this is a place of business.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Stand and Fight [3.20]
<dl><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : You know, I think that women are just about ready to say, if you come up to us with a gun or a knife, you better be prepared to use it right then and there, because we are not going anywhere with you. And we are not going to be dug up, raped and mutilated months later on some rural road. We are going to be prepared to stand and fight with dignity in the parking lots and the shopping centers and the driveways of America. But buddy, you better be prepared to do the same, because even at the very least, one of us is going to be walking funny.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : You know what gets me even more is that twisted ankle business. That is so annoying.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : What twisted ankle business?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : Oh, you know how they always show some young blonde thing in high heels with her bosom popping out of the dress, you know, running away from some monster or killer or something, and she's doing pretty good, she's making pretty good time until *snap* she twists that ankle. And then she just lies there til the monster polishes her off. I mean, I guess that's what you get for having big breasts and running around on three inch stilts.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well what do you want her to do, Mary Jo? Stand up and beat the tar out of Frankenstein?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : I want a movie where a woman with a gun knows how to use it, and doesn't let some man wrench it out of her wimpy little wrist. I want a movie where the hero is Charlene, not Charles Bronson.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Stand and Fight [3.20]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Mary Jo finds herself being followed through a parking garage.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : NO!!! Back off, buddy. Lay a finger on me and I'll kick you so hard your whole family will feel it. 9 - 1 - 1&#160;!!!</dd></dl>

Now if you're in there being either bored to death or held prisoner by this nerd maniac. Then I suggest you turn on all the lights right now.

And we're proud of our crazy people. We don't hide them up in the attic. We bring 'em right down to the living room and show 'em off. See, Phyllis, no one in the South ever asks if you have crazy people in your family. They just ask what side they're on.</dd><dd> <b>  Phyllis </b> : Oh?

Lee's roommate in college. Our other grandfather helped write the Georgia Constitution. I myself have stood in the rose garden with Jimmy Carter. So even if we do, on this particular day, happen to have our head temporarily stuck in a fence, we are not going to take any crap off some two-bit, low-level bureaucratic usherette.</dd></dl>

Don't you think her pantyhose are a little dark for her dress?"</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Now, listen, I have a lighter pair right here.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Suzanne, of all the experiences I would like to avoid, I believe having my pantyhose changed in the front hallway of the Governor's Mansion would rank right up there.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Well, just excuse me for livin'. It wasn't something I was going to particularly enjoy myself, anyway.</dd></dl>

Last night I got my feelings hurt because I came to this reunion thinking I was beautiful... and what I find out was that I'm fat... at least you think I am. But that isn't the biggest change in me.

First you kept us waiting for 35 minutes.

If that's what you think I was doing, then obviously you don't have the artistic sensibility required to work with me.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : No, Ms. Langford.

It's just a souvenir of someone we loved.</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : Maybe. All I'm saying is . . . you own a mink.

The doctors wanted to cut it off of me. But naturally, I couldn't let 'em. I mean after all, they're doctors, not tailors. Doctors should stick to cutting up things like hearts and livers, not important things like fur coats. So I have been stuck inside this thing. Do you know what it means to wear a fur coat 24 hours a day for a week? It's hot. It's bulky, and it's starting to smell. I can't go outside because dogs follow me around, and I'm not happy. I don't want to see a fur coat for the rest of my life. I don't want to see fur, I don't want to hear fur, I don't even want to open the refrigerator and see some old food with fur on it.</dd></dl>

Then my purse came open... and y'know I had that box of baby suppositories in there. They just flew everywhere. There I was, on my hands and knees, wet, sobbing, mascara running down my face, my pantyhose twisted, trying to gather up all these little white firecrackers... ...y'know. Two of the secretaries had to lift me off the floor and help me to my car. Or maybe they were throwing me out... I don't know. I never looked back.</dd></dl>

Well this was the original that it was based on.</dd><dd> <b>  Tourist </b> : This used to be a whore house?</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Alright!! That's it.

You just want to sell the myth... the myth of the Old South. You all know that myth, don't ya? Happy darkies singing in the field while Miss Scarlett primps around throwing hissy fits. Well that's an insult. It isn't the South. It's an insult to all the people who lived and died here not so very long ago. We Southerners have had to endure many things. But one thing we Southerners don't have to endure is a bunch of bored housewives turning historical homes into theme parks, not to mention ill-mannered tourists with their Big Gulps, Mysties, Slurpees, and Frosties, their dirty feet overflowing rubber thongs, and babies who sneeze fudgecicle juice! Out!! Out of my house!! As God is my witness... I will burn it down myself before I let you in again!!</dd><dd> <i>  [The tourists applaud...] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Tourist </b> : Wow!

If I miss my dinner with Jimmy and Rosalind Carter because of this, you're going to pay and pay big. I'm going to find you and hunt you down like a dog! I'm talking about you running through the woods in the snow with blood hounds ripping your clothes off! And remember, Charlene, I have your address. You'd be wise to ask yourself "Do I know where my baby is?"!</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : Julia? Julia!? (hangs up) Oh my gosh, she threatened Olivia.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : What'd she say?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlene </b> : She said she was going to hunt me down like a dog and hire blood hounds to rip my clothes off!

I mean, when this is all over she'll realize I had to do it and forgive me, don't you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Suzanne </b> : I think you and your baby should get some black wigs on and get the hell out of town.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary Jo </b> : Maybe Bill can put in for a transfer.

And yet you are perfectly comfortable smearing your face with white grease paint and annoying pedestrians all over Atlanta. Interesting. No really, Janice, I think it's time you came to a decision. As a matter of fact, I think it's time you all came to a decision. We've been here almost three days, and apparently you people have nothing better to do then to sit around here hogging up the taxpayers' money, eating baskets of fried cheese and staying at the Fair Price Motel. Which I understand some of you think is the nicest place you've stayed in a while. (The "no-lip woman" fumes) Well, let me tell you something, it is not the nicest place I've been in a while. And for your further information, I'm having dinner with a former president and first lady of the United States tonight, because we are all going to be out of here. And the reason we're all going to be out of here is that this case is very simple. Did any of you listen to the judge's instructions? He practically told us to acquit. The case is frivolous! The defendant was not negligent. Case closed! Q.E.D.! Over and out! Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more! Go up to the table and mark your ballots, and if you don't mark them right, I'm going rip that fire extinguisher off the wall and blow your overfed, under-read, simple-minded butts out onto the Fair Price Motel parking lot!</dd><dd> <b>  No-Lip Woman </b> : I don't think jury members are supposed to threaten each other. I don't appreciate that.</dd><dd> <b>  Julia </b> : Oh, really? Well, I don't appreciate you leaving you big ol' box of June Allyson bladder pads on my night stand for all the maids and bellboys to see! Of course, you don't care if you never get out of here; you don't even have to get up to go to the bathroom! Now, I am passing these slips for the final ballot, and I want to tell you right now, read my lips: Mark your slip wrong, and I will wrap it around a fried cheese ball and shove it down your throat!</dd></dl>

I'm mad because in a Seminole, Oklahoma police station, there's a poster of a naked woman that says "Women make bad cops." I'm mad because in spite of the fact that we scrub the nations' floors, wash the dishes, have all the babies and commit very little of the crime, still we only make 58 cents on the dollar. And I don't know about the rest of you women out there, but I don't give a damn if people think I'm a feminist or a fruitcake!
