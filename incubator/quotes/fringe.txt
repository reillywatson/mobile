<dl><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Let me ask you something. My father... not my favorite. He is without a doubt the most self-absorbed, twisted, abusive, <i>  brilliant </i> , myopic son of a bitch on the planet... So he was a chemist. That much I already know. He worked out of a basement lab in Harvard doing research for a toothpaste company. I also know that there was an accident at the lab one night and my father was arrested, beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home. But here's the thing, Olivia. My gut tells me that your friend's life... the one hanging in the balance... not gonna be saved by a tube of toothpaste.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : <i>  [Pause] </i> He worked out of Harvard, but not on toothpaste. He was part of a classified U.S. Army experimental program called Kelvin Genetics. They gave him their resources to do whatever work he wanted, which was primarily in an area called Fringe Science.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : When you say 'Fringe Science', you mean pseudo science?</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : I suppose. Things like mind-control, teleportation, astral projection, invisibility, genetic mutation, re-animation--</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Whoa, excuse me for a sec, re-animation? Really? So you're telling me... what? My father was Dr. Frankenstein?</dd></dl>

He gets obsessed about certain foods. It's weird.</dd><dd> <b>  Philip </b> : We need him to focus.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : To focus? Mr. Broyles, two-thirds of the time, my father's not even lucid. And in those rare and unpredictable moments of clarity, he rambles on about the foods and beverages that he missed while he was incarcerated in a mental institution for the better part of the last two decades. To say that he's not focused... is to say that he's a biped. Which is to say, you're absolutely right, he's not focused and also it's not going to change any time soon. I'm his son. I'm not a puppeteer. I don't have a remote control. There's no master switch I can flick and turn him into the man I wish had raised me. Or even somebody I don't have to babysit everyday. <i>  [pause] </i> I guess I've had that on my mind for awhile.</dd><dd> <b>  Philip </b> : Apparently.</dd></dl>

Of course, it's a problem! A bullet in the head would normally indicate significant brain trauma.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Well, it would also indicate that he's dead, but you didn't seem to have a problem with that.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : This procedure's not like removing tonsils.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : I've never had a conversation with a dead guy before.

<dl><dd> <i>  [Walter singing 'Deck the Halls' while playing with red and green lights] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Hey, Walter, don't you think it's a little early in the season for the yuletide cheer?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : I'm reciting Christmas carols in an attempt to jar loose some details from my subconscious to remember where I heard mention of the green and red lights, but sadly, it hasn't yet worked.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : So you thought it would be more useful to work on your Christmas tree decorations?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Though I can't recall where I heard of the lights, it did give me an idea, a theory as to how the boy was taken. I was hired to design a technology, an intricate pattern of flashing lights intended to create a suggestive state of hypnosis. Theoretically, the test subjects would do whatever commanded. Bark like a dog, dance a jig, wash the car...</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : The U.S. government had you working on mind control?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Not the government. It was an advertising agency. They hoped to broadcast the flashing lights during commercials so the viewers would have no choice but to buy their products. Unfortunately, it merely caused nausea. Which was unfortunate because apparently people don't like to shop when they feel like they're going to throw up.</dd></dl>

We think we understand how it was that Ben was abducted. Those red and green flashing lights? They put the father into a hypnogogic state.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : And we think we might've I.D.ed the woman responsible.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : I have it! Christmas, Christmas leading to Christmas carols, one of which is 'Jingle Bells' which lead naturally to 'Dashing Through the Snow', which of course, inevitably leads one to Dash.</dd><dd> <b>  Astrid </b> : To dash?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Dashel Kim... the man who mentioned the lights to me. I'm sure of it.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : Where is he, Walter?

Season 1
Safe[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : What we perceive as solid matter is mostly empty space. Just as we may perceive that a life is full that is actually a series of empty encounters.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : He's been like that all day. It's been awesome.</dd></dl>

Season 2
Jacksonville[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : <i>  [on the phone] </i> You've got to be kidding me.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : Congratulations, Mr. Bishop. You've just won an all expense paid trip to New York City.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : I thought I told you people to take me off your contestant list.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : Not according to our records. <i>  [smiles] </i> It says here that you're a fan of fine dining and excitement!</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Do you have a supervisor? Anybody there I could complain to, because this has to stop.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : Did I mention there's excitement?</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : <i>  [hangs up] </i> Walter, wake up.

<dl><dd> <b>  Astrid </b> : What am I looking for?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Anything that looks like it doesn't belong.</dd><dd> <b>  Astrid </b> : I think this qualifies. Richard Nixon on a silver dollar.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : That's disturbing.</dd><dd> <b>  Astrid </b> : So when you separate them, Walter, how are you going to tell them apart?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Mr. Pratchett from over there was married, he was wearing a wedding ring.</dd><dd> <b>  Astrid </b> : So as far as his wife will ever know he just disappeared?

Season 2
Jacksonville[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : I think I'm starting to understand why the process didn't work. You <i>  are </i> different. You're not that frightened child anymore. I thought all we needed was a heightened emotional response from you, but I was wrong. We needed a specific one: fear! And you're not capable of that anymore. Not like she was. What we did to you, you found a way to protect yourself. You channeled your fear into anger, which is why you're so good at your job, but if you want to save those people you have to find your way back to that scared little girl.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : And how do we do that?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : I don't know.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : <i>  [walks away and finds the room she was frightened in as a child, then sits in the corner] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Hey. Is this a part of Walter's test? Are you all right?</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : No. I'm not afraid of anything anymore.</dd></dl>

Let those people disappear.</dd><dd> <b>  Broyles </b> : There are times when the only choices you have left are bad ones.</dd></dl>

Jacksonville[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Olivia, you... <i>  [Pauses] </i> I've never met anyone, who can do the things that you do.</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : Peter, I'm scared.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Don't be. <i>  [They lean in to kiss each other, but Olivia pulls away] </i> What's wrong?</dd><dd> <b>  Olivia </b> : Peter, I'm scared! <i>  [Runs out of the room, up to the roof to find the shimmering building] </i></dd></dl>
Season 2
Jacksonville[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Where are you going?</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Me? I'm going out for drinks.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Who are you drinking with?</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Olivia.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Agent Dunham?! A date?</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : No, just drinks. Apparently that's what normal people do. They go out for drinks. If you need to reach me, I'll leave the number of the restaurant right here, okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : <i>  [knocking] </i> She's here, Peter.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : I know. I heard it, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Shall I get the door?</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Absolutely not. In fact, it would be my preference if you could be someplace else altogether.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Oh, where?</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : Chicago? <i>  [opens door] </i> Hey, come on in. I know a great place that's just a couple of blocks. I thought we could walk.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : <i>  [notices Olivia looking at Peter as he shimmers] </i> Agent Dunham.</dd><dd> <b>  Peter </b> : I'll go get my coat.</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Olivia, please don't tell him.</dd></dl>

Season 2
Peter[2.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Young Peter </b> : You're not my father, are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : Of course I am. Who else would I be? And I'm going to make you all better.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Peter[2.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Walter </b> : I realized at that moment that despite what I'd promised, what I fully intended to do, that I could never take Peter back. The way she looked at him. I saw in her what I feared most in myself when I saw him: I couldn't lose him again. It was the first hole, Olivia. The first breach. The first crack in the pattern of cracks. Spaces between the worlds. And it's my fault. You can't imagine what it's like to lose a child.</dd></dl>
