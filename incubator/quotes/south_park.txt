<dl><dd> <b>  Announcer of the ADA </b> : Fellow dentists! As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth-fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this: A giant half-chicken, half-squirrel, that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest, for genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring. We believe also, that the creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra, and that it...</dd><dd> <b>  Dr Foley </b> : Excuse me, I think I have a more <i>  logical </i> theory!</dd><dd> <b>  Announcer of the ADA </b> : Well, by all means, Mr Foley, enlighten us!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr Foley </b> : I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket.

They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.

I switched it with Chef's. <i>  [Chef looks like he's been used] </i> It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. <i>  [Stan and Kyle are stunned] </i> I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your weiner. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. <i>  [a shot of Cartman talking to Denkins, who is armed] </i> I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your weiner bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. <i>  [a shot of Scott talking with his parents] </i> And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. <i>  [the Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the "starving" pony.

And of course, to steal the bodies... <i>  [a shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away] </i> After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could personally tell you about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. <i>  [more faces of horror behind Cartman] </i> Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? <i>  [a gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] </i> I call it, "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Tenorman Chili."</dd><dd> <b>  Scott </b> : <i>  [looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what's just happened] </i> Oh my God! <i>  [gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom's wedding ring, still on her finger; he tosses it away] </i> Oh my God! <i>  [vomits off to the side] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Cartman </b> : <i>  [leaping up on the table and sings] </i> Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!

Butters' Very Own Episode[5.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Chris Stotch </b> : And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys , Congressman Condit , and O.J. . We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you, and we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a <i>  liar!" </i> <i>  [points at the crowd, and Condit's fixed-grin face is shown] </i> <i>  "You know something that you're not telling us, you slimy scumbag liar!" </i> <i>  [back to Chris] </i> You know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that <i>  murderer" </i> ! <i>  [a shot of O.J.] </i> <i>  "You got away with murder, you murdering, lying waste of life!" </i> <i>  [back to Chris] </i> And to me, people might say things like, <i>  [a shot of Condit] </i> <i>  "Liar! Tell us what you know, you goddamned liar!" </i> <i>  [back to Chris] </i> And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, <i>  [a shot of the Ramseys] </i> <i>  "You know goddamn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you murdering murderers!" </i> <i>  [a shot of O.J.] </i> <i>  "Confess!" </i> <i>  [a shot of Condit] </i> <i>  "Liar! Confess!!" </i> <i>  [back to Chris] </i> You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.</dd></dl>
