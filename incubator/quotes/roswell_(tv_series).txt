Season One
Leaving Normal
<dl><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> The tough thing about following your heart is what people forget to mention, that sometimes your heart takes you to places you shouldn't be, places that are as scary as they are exciting and as dangerous as they are alluring, and sometimes your heart takes you to places that can never lead to a happy ending. And that's not even the difficult part. The difficult part is when you follow your heart, you leave normal, you go into the unknown. And once you do, you can never go back.</dd></dl>
Season One
Missing
<dl><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> It's funny how the world changes sometimes, how the streets you walked your entire life seem darker, colder. How the silence isn't so quiet any more. How eyes you've barely even noticed now look at nothing but you. How the walk home every night is no longer routine, but a victory. And then you begin to wonder. Maybe it's not the world that's changed. Maybe it's just you.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> October 28th. I've missed a few days. But in my absence I've been thinking about some things, about life before Max Evans saved me, of how I used to pray for something to happen, something to just break the routine, you know, of school and work. Something that would make a small town feel bigger, that would make a small town girl feel bigger, too. And ever since I got my wish and Max Evans patched a bullet hole two inches below my ribs, I realized one thing: that the bigger your world gets, the bigger your problems get, too.</dd></dl>

Here were my plans last night: finish my shift, dinner with the parents, half-hour of talking to Maria on the phone, then dive into this issue I've been having with geometry and hopefully finish in time to watch this A&amp;E biography on Madame Curie. Instead, I took off in an open-air vehicle that probably shouldn't be allowed on the road to begin with, broke into a house, essentially stole things from it, and engaged in general bonding with aliens. Welcome to my world.</dd></dl>

And that no matter how crazy your life has gotten there's this one moment, this perfect moment, where you could just say that no matter what happens, nothing can take this moment away from me...</dd><dd> <i>  [A horse appears in the road ahead] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> : And then, something does.</dd></dl>

Blood Brother
<dl><dd> <b>  Alex </b> : See, I mean, my point is... is that there's no garage band scene here at Roswell, you know? Which makes for a potential genius situation.

A couple weeks ago, if someone were to ask me who I would trust with my life other than my parents, I would have said you without skipping a beat. And now... now I feel like I don't even know who you are.</dd><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : Alex, I want to tell you, I do, but... it's not my secret to tell. Alex, I need to know what you told Sheriff Valenti.</dd><dd> <b>  Alex </b> : I want to tell ya, Liz... but it's not my secret to tell.</dd></dl>
Season One
Heatwave
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> : Liz, I think that what I'm afraid of isn't that we try this and it works out really badly. What I'm afraid of is we try it and it works out really well.

I just couldn't bear to hurt you.</dd></dl>
Season One

Season One
Toy House
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Well, I hope so, because dealing with frick and frack over there is one thing, but we can't bring adults into this and expect them to handle it. Adults are the enemy, Max. Remember that.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : Michael, you say everyone is the enemy.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : They are.</dd></dl>
Season One
Toy House
<dl><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : It's cheating. You can't just wave your hand over a problem and make it go away. Why don't you figure out what's really going on with you, Michael...why you can't just piece together an apology like any normal human being. Oops. Maybe that's the problem</dd></dl>

The Convention
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Yeah, you know what, I do. I'm here trying to figure out the meaning of my existence, and I'm tired of having to wade through the kooks like you and the freak shows like this in order to do it.</dd></dl>
Season One
The Convention
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> : What did you tell him? Why did he come after me? You're the Sheriff. You're supposed to protect me. But all you've done is go after me! You believe all these crazy things. You're just like Hubble. You want me? Well, here I am! Take me.</dd></dl>

I'm a little lost. You mean Liz and Max were cleaning erasers when they created this disturbance?</dd><dd> <b>  Principal </b> : No. They were what we used to call "making out."

You were the first one to take the plunge, Maria!</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : Michael and I just kissed. Okay, fine. We did a little more than kissing. But, look, I wasn't getting visions, and I didn't have glowing hickeys and rashes and... look, Liz, the bottom line is that we don't know what this is about, all right? Female spiders can, you know, bite off the males' heads after they mate. What if they need someone to mate with to get certain information, you know? And then... Blttt! You know?</dd><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : What're you been trying to say? That Max is just gonna bite my head off?</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : Uh, no. What I'm saying is, how do you know that he's not like using you?</dd><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : Maria, because it... it... it feels right. I'm sorry. It feels right in a way that nothing has felt right in my life before.</dd></dl>
Season One
Sexual Healing
<dl><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : I want you to know that what I said about you being all shut down and that's why I had to fake the flashes, that was... wrong and very unfair. If something went wrong, it was because of me. I'm the one who's scared. I mean, I fake all kinds of things all the time with everybody. It's just you were the first person I actually ever admitted it to.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Well... thanks for sayin' that, but it's not really true.</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : What do you mean?</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : It's not true about you being shut down all the time. I happen to know that for a fact.</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : Really? How?</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Because you let me see you. The red sneakers, Maria.

You need me now, more than you have before, alright?</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : No, I don't need anyone.</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : Well, maybe I do. Did you ever think of that? I mean, look at Max and Liz. They can't bear to be separated. But you, you can just throw me away. Just like that. Why is that, Michael?

<dl><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : As beautiful as that is, Max... you can't keep doing it. I know it seems like there's no reason for those kids to have cancer or for a father to get killed saving his child or for any of it... but maybe there is.

You have that one option, all right?</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : No, no, no. What's my second option?</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : You're not capable of it, I promise.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Just say it.</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : Form an emotional bond with Laurie. <i>  (Michael shakes his head) </i> All right, fine. You don't like that answer, then go show her the secret alien handshake.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : <i>  (sighs) </i> Okay, fine. What kind of psychobabble, Oprah crap do I gotta tell her?</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : I can't put the words in your mouth, Michael. It's gotta come from you. It's gotta come from your-- it's gotta come from whatever organ you have sitting in for your heart. Just go over there and tell her in your own words that she can trust you, and make sure that she feels that you're being completely, emotionally honest.</dd></dl>
Season Two
Disturbing Behavior
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Look, Laurie, I know a lot of people think you're pretty crazy. But the truth is, knowing everything you've been through, you seem pretty normal to me. I just want you to know that whatever you are to me-- a sister, a cousin, whatever-- you're the only family I've ever known, and I just found you. I don't... I don't want to let you go. I know you're scared to death of me, but... if you could find some way to trust me... I mean, I got all kinds of faults. And this one over here, you know (gestures to Maria) she can list them off for you if you want later on, but... the one thing I am is loyal. I will not turn my back on you. That's all I got to say. I don't know.</dd></dl>

Viva Las Vegas
<dl><dd> <b>  Jim Valenti </b> : So you skipped school. Missing class is excusable if it involves saving a planet-- yours, mine, or any other. It is not acceptable if it is done in the name of under-age gambling. Is that clear?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Tess </b> : You're scared to go home.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : What is home? Is home really up there?

I want to understand it more and more, but it just feels like this dream... this, this dream that I can never really quite touch or see or...feel. And earth just seems so much more... real.</dd></dl>
Season Two
It's Too Late and It's too Bad
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> : Michael. The idea that Alex might have died just because we're here... I can't bear it. All those times you would run off chasing some clue to find out where we come from. Why we're here. Where we belong. I always thought you were chasing something that wasn't out there, because in my heart, I believed that we belonged here, you know? That we were human. Lately, I've been thinking that you might have been right all along.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Lately, I've been thinking I might have been wrong all along.</dd></dl>

You're gonna get on a spaceship and go away, and you being the perfect boyfriend right now is really not helping me. I can't lose anyone else, Michael. My heart can't handle it.</dd></dl>

Season Two
The Departure
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> : I always thought when we graduated I would give you my ring. <i>  [handing her the pendant they found at Atherton's] </i> It looks like I won't graduate, so this is something from where I'll be.</dd><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : I can't believe that this is what I have of you.

To me, earth isn't home and whatever's out there isn't home, but you're my home.</dd></dl>
Season Two
The Departure
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : There's a lot about you, Maria. There's a lot about you, but I think what means the most to me is that you're open. You know I can look into your eyes and I can see you. I can see what you're thinking. I can see what you're feeling. How much I mean to you sometimes, how much I piss you off sometimes. But I can always see you.</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : I see you, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : No, no you don't see me. You know when Max and Liz would kiss, and Liz would get the flashes? And when we would kiss, you didn't. I know how much that hurt you.</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : That doesn't matter to me any more, Michael.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : The reason you didn't get the flashes is because I didn't let you get them. I didn't let you see me. I've never let anyone see me before... because there are things inside of me that I don't want people to see. There's things inside of me that I'm not so proud of. But I've thought about it, and I want you to see me.</dd></dl>
Season Two
The Departure
<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : Max... I can't go. Ever since we came out of the pods, I've been on some quest to figure out where I belong. I finally found home. The weird thing is, it's here, it's on earth.</dd></dl>
Season Two

Busted
<dl><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : I want to do this with you, Max. Together.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Liz </b> : Because if I had lost a child, I would want you to help me find him. But that's only part of the reason. The other part is that I don't want you to slip away from me. I know what it's like to be with you, and I know what it's like to be apart from you. And I would rather be with you.</dd></dl>

You know that.</dd><dd> <b>  Max </b> : I'm sorry. I love her.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Parker </b> : I don't give a damn about your love. Because of you, my daughter was arrested for armed robbery. She could've been killed. Did you ever think about that? Tell me you're not dangerous, Max. Tell me that being with you doesn't put my little girl's life in jeopardy. Yeah. That's what I thought.

<dl><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : First day of school, third grade. I'm standing by the lunch line arguing with that ass Mr. Trevors. He tells me that the cafeteria won't take my food stamps. I say that they're for food, aren't they? And he looks down on me, and he says with that scraggly mustache and that stupid comb over, he says, I don't take lip from welfare punks. I'm about to kick his balls up into his throat, but then I feel someone watching me. And it feels like a heat lamp turned on in the back on my neck, and I turned around and there you are. You're sitting at a table all by yourself. You're just staring right at me. So I walk over and I sit down. You're still staring at me with those big eyes. And you push your tray of food over to me, and you said that you can have my lunch. Right then, I knew you were different. You know, you were different like I was different like people liked you and wanted you around <i>  [trying not to cry] </i> , I want you around. I want you around, so please don't go. <i>  [he cries and lays his head down on her chest. He squeezes her hand, and we see Michael's hand turn white and the white travels to Isabel's hand and up her arm. She puts her hand on his back.

You and me. Us. Just the whole long, stupid story...</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : ...Thanks...</dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : But I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's meant so much to me, y'know. From day one, from the moment I kidnapped you and stole your car... I knew you were the girl for me. I never wanted anyone else...</dd><dd> <b>  Maria </b> : Michael... <i>  (takes a step towards him, sad, but touched.) </i></dd><dd> <b>  Michael </b> : I still don't. Just...

Season Three
Graduation
<dl><dd> <b>  Max </b> : I'm a member of that group of... outsiders. I always knew I was different and for a long, long time, all I wanted was to be another face in the crowd... but in the end, it wasn't possible. I guess it never was. So from now on, I'll just concentrate on being who I really am. Some of you might not like that. Some of you might even... find that frightening. But that's not my problem any more. I have to be who I really am and let fate take care of the rest. So... thank you, Roswell... Thank you for... for letting me live among you. Thank you for giving me a family. Thank you for giving me a home.</dd></dl>
