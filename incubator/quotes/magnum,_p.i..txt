<dl><dd> <i>  [Magnum warily watches as a shark circles him] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [narrating] </i> I once had one follow me on my surf ski. He just hung a few meters off my rudder. I know I set a personal speed record getting back to shore that day.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Letter to a Duchess[4.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : For a moment, I failed to remember that the ways of a gentleman are patently foreign to you. I revere words like honor, integrity, chivalry -- words that are clearly not in your vocabulary.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Higgins, enough! Knocking my rubber chicken or my sloppy habits is within the rules, but you're attacking my character. I would like to think you don't mean that.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Yes, I'm sorry. It's just that you can't know what it's like to care deeply for someone and have your hope taken.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Yes, I can.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Squeeze Play[4.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : You know lads, I sometimes view myself as a later-day Job , constantly being tested by our Creator. How else could I possibly justify four major wars, dozens of minor conflicts, seven natural disasters, and...</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Aha! Double play Tigers!</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : ...Him.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Squeeze Play[4.7]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Higgins finds camera lens cap... without camera or lens] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Oh my god. Where is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [acting innocent] </i> Where's what?</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : The 110mm lens this cap should be covering.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Higgins, I can explain.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : I am utterly sick and tried of those four pathetic words "Higgins I can explain".</dd></dl>
Season 4
A Sense of Debt[4.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [narrates] </i> When you spend your every working day basking in the balmy breezes of paradise, when you play year round on the beautiful sunny beaches of the Pacific, where do you dream of going on a vacation? The answer is obvious: Detroit. Reason one: Detroit's a fun city. Reason two: There's a superior group of athletes there known as the Tigers! Reason three:</dd><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> : A free trip? You think you're going to get a free trip to Detroit on my tab Thomas?</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : T.C., I'm doing you a favor.</dd></dl>
Season 4
A Sense of Debt[4.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> : And Robin Master's little red wagon for the whole entire time that you're gone. Sorry Thomas, but I need wheels and I'm having problems with the van.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : What's wrong with it?</dd><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> : It's not a Ferrari.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Operation: Silent Night[4.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : I, of course, have spent many a Christmas away from home and family. More times than I care to remember, in more places than I care to remember; Forgotten battlefields, and sometimes even forgotten wars. I think being at war, makes Christmas all the more bittersweet - peace on earth, and goodwill to all men, and all that.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Operation: Silent Night[4.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> :Rick, there's a bug in your hair.</dd><dd> <b>  Rick </b> :Yeah, right.</dd><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> :No, really, Rick, there's a praying mantis.</dd><dd> <b>  Rick </b> : <i>  (mimicks) </i> "Rick, there's a bug in your pocket," "Rick, there's a centipede," "Rick, there's a lizard." Well, I'm not buyin' it! <i>  (Rick walks off) </i></dd><dd> <b>  Rick </b> : <i>  (screams) </i></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [Magnum is at a fancy dress party in his normal trademark look] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Marge </b> : Great costume!</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Oh, this isn't a costume.</dd><dd> <b>  Nolan </b> : Really?! You wear that shirt in public?</dd></dl>
Season 4
No More Mr. Nice Guy[4.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Magnum, stop living in the past.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Me? Me?! Higgins, you've enshrined yours. You quote every boring war story like it was carved in stone.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Boring?</dd><dd> <b>  Rick </b> : Don't worry, Higgins, I like your stories.</dd><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> : Yeah, me too.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : I do think I tell them with a certain panache.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Paradise Blues[4.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [narrates] </i> Ms. Wagner, my 11th grade English teacher, created a scandal in my hometown when she put All the King's Men on our mandatory reading list. She said she wanted us to understand the fatal attraction some men have for the very thing that will destroy them. Her love for the book got her fired and I never quite understood the attraction she was talking about, until the first day I saw Alex Carter and the way T.C. was looking at her.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Return of Luther Gillis[4.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Higgins, I can explain.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : I knew I could count on hearing that pathetic phrase once again, it is as regular as the rising and setting of the-</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Do you wanna know why or not?</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Not.</dd></dl>
Season 4
The Return of Luther Gillis[4.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Luther </b> : <i>  [narrating] </i> I was beginning to get the feeling that I was stuck with the big guy for the duration. The only thing more depressing than that was this case, because we'd run out of leads. You try being a detective with no leads. It's like a tailor without a needle, or Godzilla without Tokyo, or...</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [narrating] </i> A bad guy without a motive.</dd><dd> <b>  Luther </b> : Did you say something?</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : What?...Nope.</dd></dl>

Season 4
I Witness[4.21]]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [narrates] </i> Hawaiian sunsets are among the most breathtakingly beautiful in the world. Grandly vibrant, uniquely different every day, they paint a palette with boundaries that stop only at the horizons of one's imagination. However, when the sun goes down, it looks the same all over the world. Whether you're in Milwaukee or Maui, it's dark.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Echoes of the Mind[5.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Lady Ashley, you look positively smashing, especially for a woman your age.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Mac's Back[5.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : After three days of surveillance, I was familiar with the rhythm of the street. At nine in the morning, those about to be sacrificed to the Hawaiian gods of sun, sea, and sand were making their ritualistic trek to the beach. I knew from experience that very few would return with their skin. At noon, the late risers and the serious souvenir hunters were prowling about, snatching up bargain buys on plastic hula skirts and cheap coral beads. At three-fifteen I got my afternoon treat. I called her Olga, for obvious reasons. The cops are pretty good about keeping hookers off the street during the day, but, I guess when you're as big as Olga, you can work any time you want. By sunset the last of the lobsters were returning from the beach, which meant my day was nearly over and all I had to show for it was a sore butt, and a case of heartburn.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Mac's Back[5.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : If you're going to drink yourself into a stupor, wouldn't whiskey be more effective?</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Too hard to keep an even buzz on with whiskey.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Fragments[5.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Higgins, we are talking about saving my life.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : What is that, compared to saving an entire species?</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Of worms?!</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : I rest my case.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Blind Justice[5.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : This morning I came to a startling and horrifying realization. Since your arrival at Robin's Nest, you have insidiously eroded away my sense of diligence. Security has fallen completely apart. The grounds are in a terrible state of neglect. This guest house should be condemned.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : It doesn't look so bad.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : The estate is completely overrun with your good-for-nothing friends, sleazy clients and unexpected guests.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : That is not true!</dd><dd> <i>  [Carol enters guest house] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Carol </b> : Hi Thomas. The gate was open, so I just came on in.</dd><dd> <i>  [Magnum hangs head] </i></dd></dl>
Season 5
Murder 101[5.08]
<dl><dd> <i>  [T.C. and Rick are roped in to pad out the numbers of Magnum's class on how to be private investigator] </i></dd><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> : I've heard that some private investigators don't even do any of that bone-numbing research and that they actually con other people to do it for them.</dd><dd> <b>  Rick </b> : Yes, I've heard that also, but surely that can't be true.</dd></dl>
Season 5
All For One[5.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Where you been, Tyler?</dd><dd> <b>  Tyler </b> : Been to an execution.</dd><dd> <b>  Rick </b> : Anybody we know?</dd><dd> <b>  Tyler </b> : Mine.</dd><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> : Well, I guess somebody messed up then.</dd></dl>
Season 5
All For One[5.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Tyler </b> : Got anything to drink?</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Certainly not. And I demand an explanation.</dd><dd> <b>  Tyler </b> : Okay, General, just don't slug me, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Rick </b> : Go ahead, Higgins, belt him if you want.</dd></dl>
Season 5
The Love-For-Sale Boat[5.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : A few vital statistics that explain why paradise is called paradise: there are three-hundred and twenty-six days of sunshine each year, an annual average temperature of eighty-six degrees, billions and billions of gallons of blue Pacific, and one Orville 'Rick' Wright, who will bet on anything.</dd></dl>
Season 5
Torah, Torah, Torah[5.21]
<dl><dd> <i>  [T.C. is brewing chili in Magnum's kitchen] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : My God, what is that odor?</dd><dd> <b>  T.C. </b> : Higgie-baby, you're talking about my Aunt Rola's original, Creole flaming, bayou blasting chilli. Wanna try a little taste?</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Not without a paramedic in attendance.</dd></dl>
Season 6
The Kona Winds[6.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : This isn't a war you know. I mean, once nature sets it's course, you can't do anything to stop it.</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : You can if you're British!</dd></dl>
Season 6
Round and Around[6.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [narrates] </i> I'm not really sure which kind of private investigator I am. The Holmesian-type with the constant deductive mind, or one with a Marlowe-type intuitive sense of the darker side of human nature? Hopefully a combination of both. At any rate, it doesn't matter. Not when you have a "little voice". I don't know, maybe a gently nagging "little voice" is just another way of adding what you know, to what you feel, but right now mine wasn't "gently nagging". It was screaming.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Find Me a Rainbow[6.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : <i>  [narrates] </i> I must've seen a hundred rainbows since I've been in the islands, but each one just seems to take my breath away, despite the best efforts of Mr. Corkall, my high school science teacher. He used to lecture our class on light reflections and refraction, polarization and prisms, but I knew, I knew that that really wasn't what rainbows were all about. So when I got a "C" on my midterm, Mr. Corkall told me that he was really worried that I would go through life not understanding the importance of geometric optics. But to tell you the truth, I was a lot more worried Mr. Corkall might go through life not understanding the importance of a rainbow.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Who is Don Luis Higgins, and Why is He Doing These Terrible Things to Me?[6.19]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Magnum is unsure if he's talking to Higgins or his half-brother] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Tell me a story. The "Gunga Din Story"!</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : For god sake Magnum, this is hardly the time!...</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : If you're Higgins, anytime is the time! The "Gunga Din Story" now!</dd><dd> <b>  Higgins </b> : Malaysia, 1943. Our regiment was hopelessly outnumbered and faced certain death. In our ranks was a young Lt. Ian Bowerly and during a lull in the battle he recited Gunga Din. I suppose to keep up our courage in face of the inevitable. His eloquent recitation grew increasingly louder until it thundered through the jungle. To our amazement, the Japanese troops walked forward. Although they spoke no English they were entranced by the poem. They allowed us all to leave the area unharmed except for poor Mr. Bowerly. As we made our escape we could hear him reciting other Kipling favorites, literally for miles. To this day, his fate remains unknown.</dd><dd> <b>  Magnum </b> : Thank you. I believe your half brother is going to assassinate the president of Costa De Rosa.</dd></dl>
