<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> So, I started hanging out with Rayanne Graff, just for fun. Just 'cause it seemed like if I didn't, I would die, or something. ...Things were getting to me. Just how people are -- how they always expect you to be a certain way. Even your best friend. ...Like, with boys, like they have it so easy. Like you have to pretend you don't notice them noticing you. ...Like cheerleaders. Can't people just cheer on their own? Like to themselves? ...School is a battlefield for your heart. So when Rayanne Graff told me my hair was holding me back, I had to listen. 'Cause she wasn't just talking about my hair. She was talking about my life.</dd></dl>

How much more can we take?</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : I just don't want to look like I'm throwing myself at him.</dd><dd> <b>  Rayanne </b> : Excuse me. People throwing themselves at people?

It -- it's just ...</dd><dd> <b>  Rickie </b> : It's an obsession.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Right. And if you make it real, it, it's not the same. It's not...it's not yours anymore. I don't know -- maybe I'd rather have the fantasy, than even him.</dd><dd> <b>  Rickie </b> : I completely understand this.</dd><dd> <b>  Rayanne </b> : I totally and completely disagree.

Season 1
Dancing in the Dark[1.2]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [voiceover, regarding Jordan] </i> We both stopped talking. Part of his sleeve was touching my arm. I don't know if he knew. Then everything started to seem perfect for some reason. The feel of his shirt against my elbow, the fact that I still had an elbow. It was the perfect moment for him to kiss me, for him to anything me.</dd><dd> <b>  Jordan </b> : <i>  [leans closer, then opens her car door] </i> Well, I gotta go, so...

It's...they're not...people just hang out. They're not -- it's not dates. There's people. Together. In a bunch.</dd><dd> <b>  Graham </b> : So was there someone else there...you like?</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> It's so strange how parents can, out of nowhere, turn psychic. It's unnerving.</dd><dd> <b>  Graham </b> : It's okay to like someone. But, I mean, boys your age can sometimes --</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Dad, I know. <i>  [pause] </i> 'Can sometimes' what?</dd><dd> <b>  Graham </b> : Can sometimes not know how to be what you want them to be.

Guns and Gossip[1.3]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Grown-ups like to tell you where they were when President Kennedy was shot, which they all know to the exact second. Which makes me almost jealous -- like I should have something important enough to know where I was when it happened. But I don't, yet. And the fact that it was a better time then, and people knew what they were supposed to do and how to make the world better...now nobody knows anything. We know who's popular, or that Social Studies is boring, or that Brian always has stomach trouble -- but nobody knows anything important. Instead of changing the world, people sit in class and write notes about other people.</dd></dl>

Gosh, they seem so different.</dd><dd> <b>  Amber </b> : Oh, you know kids. They find one person and they just can't get enough of them! It's like being in love, only they're not allowed to have sex.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : Riiiight.</dd><dd> <b>  Amber </b> : No, don't you remember? There'd be, like, this one person, who had, like, perfect hair, or perfect breasts, or they were just so funny, and you just wanted to eat them up -- just live in their bed, and just be them. It's like everybody else was in black and white, and that person was in color. Well, Rayanne thinks Angela is in color. Major color.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Rayanne </b> : So, not to shock you, but your dad's attractive.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Oh, I'm sure!</dd><dd> <b>  Rayanne </b> : Not that I'd attack him, or anything, but I wouldn't leave me alone with him, either. It's not just physical. He's...nice. You just have a really nice dad. He's really nice.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> When someone compliments your parents, there's, like, nothing to say. It's like a stun gun to your brain.</dd><dd> <b>  Rickie </b> : Plus, his stubble is the perfect length.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : He doesn't have stubble! He ran out of disposable razors that morning; he was all disturbed about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Rayanne </b> : Oh! In-touch-with-his-emotions Dad!</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [laughing] </i> Shut up!</dd><dd> <b>  Rayanne </b> : Ignore Angela!

The Zit[1.5]

Just face it -- I have.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : How can you say that-- how can you possibly --</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : By looking in the mirror, okay? By looking at you, with the way you look at me.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : How do I look at you?</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : By the way you instruct me on how to wash my face so I don't get zits. Like you have to fix me, like you're ashamed of me.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : Oh, no -- Angela, sweetheart, no!</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : You expect me to beautiful, because you're beautiful. Well, I'm sorry -- I'm not. I'm just not.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Zit[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sharon </b> : Why do girls have to tear each other down?</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : I guess 'cause they're jealous. I mean, I was. Of you.

The Zit[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Sometimes it seems like we're all living in some kind of prison, and the crime is how much we hate ourselves.

Possibly even me.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Student </b> : So why are you here? You the new substitute?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Why am I here? Yeah, good question. I'm the new substitute, yes. I'm here quite simply to get paid. Assuming all of you can read and write, I don't perceive any emergency situation. That's all. Continue wasting your lives. <i>  [he pulls a folded newspaper out of his knapsack] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sharon </b> : So, um...are we like, dismissed?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Do you want to be dismissed?</dd><dd> <b>  Sharon </b> : No, you just said that...you just said that was all you had to say, so...</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : I will be here for the next forty-seven minutes. Whether you will also be here for that time is, to be candid, your decision.</dd><dd> <b>  Jordan </b> : What's the catch?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : No catch. If you don't want to be here, go. I'm not gonna stop you. <i>  [Jordan immediately climbs out of his desk and heads for the door] </i> Well, you know, there is just, you know, one catch. We will be discussing you in your absence, but you know, if you don't mind that...</dd><dd> <b>  Jordan </b> : Yeah, right.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Oh, it's no joke. I have no lesson planned. Trashing you in your absence will help, uh, pass the time. Right? It could, uh, possibly be educational as well.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : So what are we supposed to do?</dd><dd> <i>  [Jordan returns to his seat] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Ah, I've known you all of five minutes and you want me to tell you what you're supposed to do?

The Substitute[1.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : My husband and I read the stuff that the kids wrote --</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Hope it didn't give him a heart attack. He seemed a bit fragile.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : Actually, it isn't my husband who had the problem.</dd><dd> <i>  [Mr. Racine smiles] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : I just think...there's this one piece in particular that I just don't feel comfortable printing.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Oh! You're afraid that Angela wrote it.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : This has nothing to do with whether Angela wrote it.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : So, this is just censorship for censorship's sake?</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Hand them over. I'll type them myself, and I'll have them Xeroxed.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : These are children! We are adults! This is not censorship! This is guiding adolescents who need...guidance!</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : That is a very reasonable opinion, and very clearly stated. Unfortunately, it's total manure.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : Excuse me?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : It's horse manure. I sense you're angry. Are you angry?</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : Yes!</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Yes! I sensed that! <i>  [laughs] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : Why is it manure?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Good question. It is manure because this journal should be about giving these students a voice, not about having their thoughts edited. If these kids aren't afraid to put their hearts on the page, why should we be afraid of them?</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : You should really teach full-time.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : We have a difference of opinion. Fine. But do you think you should be in the position of deciding because you run a printing press and I don't?</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : Do you expect me to answer that question?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : <i>  [pause] </i> No, I don't.</dd><dd> <i>  [He hands the papers back to her and starts to leave] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Patty </b> : So. Did Angela write it?</dd><dd> <i>  [He smirks and walks out] </i></dd></dl>
Season 1
The Substitute[1.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : I heard you left your family -- abandoned them.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : I see.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : So are you saying you didn't? I mean, what's the truth?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Well, there are a couple of truths. One truth is I left my family. The other truth is my wife is far better off without me. Yes. I got out. I escaped. I broke out of a prison of my own making, and many, many people want to punish me for that -- maybe even you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : I'm trying to --</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : 'To' what? To understand? Look, my struggle for freedom is mine. Get your own. Get out before it's too late, Amanda.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : 'Get out'? Get out of what?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : That mind-control factory -- that warehouse they store you in because they don't know what else to do with you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : You're telling me to drop out of high school?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Racine </b> : Good question. Yes. Run for your life. Save your life. Let the walls of your gingerbread house come crashing down. Or not.</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : It's Angela. And I have to say I don't think leaving high school is the answer. I don't think leaving anything is. The thing is...is I kind of admired you.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Love is when you look into someone's eyes and suddenly you go all the way inside, to their soul, and you both know instantly. I always imagined I'd fall in love nursing a blind soldier who was wounded in battle. Or maybe while rescuing someone in the middle of a blizzard, seconds before the avalanche hits.

This person means something to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Graham </b> : Is there a person who means something?</dd><dd> <b>  Angela </b> : Yes, and I don't see why you can't just trust that.
