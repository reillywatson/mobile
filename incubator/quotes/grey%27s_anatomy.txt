Superhero or something... If they could see me now.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : When I told my mother I wanted to go to medical school, she tried to talk me out of it. Said I didn't have what it takes to be a surgeon, that I'd never make it. So the way I see it, superhero sounds pretty damn good.</dd></dl>

A Hard Day's Night[1.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I can't think of a single reason why I should be a surgeon, but I can think of a thousand reasons why I should quit. They make it hard on purpose. There are lives in our hands. There comes a moment when it's more than just a game, and you either take that step forward or turn around and walk away. I could quit but here's the thing, I love the playing field.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : Every intern wants to perform their first surgery. That's not your job. Do you know what your job is? To make your resident happy. Do I look happy? No! Why? Because <i>  my </i> interns are whiny. You know what will make me look happy? Having the code team staffed, having the trauma pages answered, having the weekend labs delivered and having someone down in the pit doing the sutures. No one holds a scalpel until I'm so happy I'm Mary Freakin' Poppins.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> At some point you have to make a decision. Boundaries don't keep other people out; they fence you in. Life is messy, that's how we're made.

Here's what I know, If you're willing to take a chance, the view from the other side is spectacular.</dd></dl>

Ugh, they're like, happy.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Kick them out.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : I can't kick them out, they just moved in.

Season 1
No Man's Land[1.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Intimacy is a four syllable word for "Here is my heart and soul, please grind them into hamburger, and enjoy." It's both desired, and feared. Difficult to live with, and impossible to live without. Intimacy also comes attached to the three R's... relatives, romance, and roommates. There are some things you can't escape. And other things you just don't want to know.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : <i>  [to Izzie] </i> You are eight feet tall. Your boobs are perfect. Your hair is down to there. If I was you I would just walk around naked all the time. I wouldn't have a job, I wouldn't have any skills, I wouldn't even know how to read. I would just be...naked.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : It's makeup.

Season 1
No Man's Land[1.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I wish there were a rulebook for intimacy. Some kind of guide to tell you when you've crossed the line. It would be nice if you could see it coming, and I don't know how you fit it on a map. You take it where you can get it, and keep it as long as you can. And as for rules, maybe there are none. Maybe the rules of intimacy are something you have to define for yourself.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Shake Your Groove Thing[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Remember when you were a kid and your biggest worry was, like, if you'd get a bike for your birthday or if you'd get to eat cookies for breakfast? Being an adult? Totally overrated. I mean seriously, don't be fooled by all the hot shoes and the great sex and the no parents anywhere telling you what to do. Adulthood is responsibility. Responsibility, it really does suck. Really, really sucks. Adults have to be places and do things and earn a living and pay the rent. And if you're training to be a surgeon, holding a human heart in your hands, hello? Talk about responsibility. Kind of makes bikes and cookies look really, really good, doesn't it? The scariest part about responsibility? When you screw up and let it slip right through your fingers.</dd></dl>

Shake Your Groove Thing[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : We're adults. When did that happen? And how do we make it stop?</dd></dl>

Shake Your Groove Thing[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [She, George and Cristina are drinking and playing cards] </i> Why did we want to be surgeons anyway?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Surgery is very serious business</dd><dd> <i>  [Cristina burps loudly; she has two cards stuck to her face] </i></dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Full House</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : <i>  [to George] </i> Royal flush. Get naked. Baby boy!</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Surgery is stupid. It's stupid.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : <i>  [She sings to George, as he strips] </i> Sexy, you're so sexy. <i>  [She takes the bottle from Meredith] </i> Give me that; you're drunk.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : I'm not driving. I'm not on call. I'm in my own house. My life is crap. And it's my party and I'll get drunk if I want to.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Shake Your Groove Thing[1.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Responsibility, it really does suck. Unfortunately, once you get past the age of braces and training bras, responsibility doesn't go away. It can't be avoided. Either someone makes us face it or we suffer the consequences. And still adulthood has it perks. I mean the shoes, the sex, the no parents anywhere telling you what to do. That's, pretty damn good.</dd></dl>

Fine, I'll just call you Bailey then.</dd><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : You know, you think you're charming, in that talented, neurotic, overly moussed hair sort of way. Good for you. But if you think I'm gonna stand back and watch while you favor her...</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : I don't favor her. She's good.</dd><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : I'm sure she is.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : You know, can I point out, technically, I'm your boss.</dd><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : You don't scare me. Look, I'm not gonna advertise your extracurricular activities with my intern.

The Self Destruct Button[1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> OK. Anyone who says you can sleep when you die, tell them to come talk to me after a few months as an intern. Of course, it's not just the job that keeps us up all night. I mean, if life's so hard already, why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves?

The Self Destruct Button[1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  George </b> : You get any sleep?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : She should oil the bedsprings, as a courtesy, or at least buy a padded headboard.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : So, who's the guy?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : You think it was just one guy doing all that work?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Do you mind if I don't think about that?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Aw, you jealous?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : I'm not jealous.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Well, I am.

I would kill for that.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : We're cutting out half the girl's brain, and it's going to work. It's outrageous. Almost makes it kind of hard to hate him.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Why do you hate him?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Oh, no reason.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Oh, you know about him and Meredith?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : You know?</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : When are you gonna figure out that I know everything?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : <i>  [to Izzie who is walking up the stairs] </i> She knows.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Oh, about doctorcest?</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : It's been going on for, like, ever.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Seriously?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : And you didn't tell us?</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Oh, you're a gossip, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : I am not!</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : I am!</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep? That's not very responsible.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Jealous? Sex all night isn't about being responsible.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : No, it's about sex all night. I can't believe you're not pissed off about this, you of all people.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Well, she works hard all day. She's good at her job, why should you care how she unwinds? I mean you like to bake all night, others like to drink, others like an occasional screaming orgasm.</dd><dd> <b>  Alex </b> : <i>  [Walking up] </i> Yeah we do.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Self Destruct Button[1.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Maybe we like the pain. Maybe we're wired that way. Because without it, I don't know, maybe we just wouldn't feel real. What's that saying? Why do I keep hitting myself with a hammer? Because it feels so good when I stop.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> The thing people forget is how good it can feel when you finally set secrets free.

Season 2
Enough Is Enough (No More Tears)[2.2]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : There's something to be said about a glass half full. About knowing when to say when. I think it's a floating line. A barometer of need and desire. It's entirely up to the individual. And depends on what's being poured. Sometimes all we want is a taste. Other times there's no such thing as enough, the glass is bottomless. And all we want, is more.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> No one likes to lose control, but as a surgeon there's nothing worse. It's a sign of weakness, of not being up to the task. And still there are times when it just gets away from you. When the world stops spinning and you realize that your shiny little scalpel isn't gonna save you. No matter how hard you fight it, you fall. And it's scary as hell. If there's an upside to free-falling, it's the chance you give your friends to catch you.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Deny, Deny, Deny[2.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> The key to surviving a surgical internship is denial. We deny that we're tired, we deny that we're scared, we deny how badly we want to succeed. And most importantly, we deny that we're in denial. We only see what we want to see and believe what we want to believe, and it works. We lie to ourselves so much that after a while the lies start to seem like the truth. We deny so much that we can't recognize the truth right in front of our faces.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Deny, Deny, Deny[2.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Addison kissed me. Meredith kissed me. My girlfriend and my wife kissed me on the same day.</dd><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : McDreamy, go sit by someone who cares.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Deny, Deny, Deny[2.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : You've got a wife.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Your life is complicated.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : I don't need complicated, I have complicated all on my own.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Stop saying yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : I'll try not to make any sudden movements.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : You think this is funny?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Addison is leaving. She doesn't have any more patients in this hospital. There's no reason for her to be here.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : No reason?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : None whatsoever.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Deny, Deny, Deny[2.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Sometimes reality has a way of sneaking up and biting us in the ass. And when the dam bursts, all you can do is swim. The world of pretend is a cage, not a cocoon. We can only lie to ourselves for so long. We are tired, we are scared, denying it doesn't change the truth. Sooner or later we have to put aside our denial and face the world. Head on, guns blazing. De Nile. It's not just a river in Egypt, it's a freakin' ocean. So how do you keep from drowning in it?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Bring the Pain[2.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Pain, it comes in all forms. The small twinge, a bit of soreness, the random pain, the normal pains that we live with everyday. Then there's the kind of pain you can't ignore. A level of pain so great that it blocks out everything else; makes the rest of your world fade away until all we can think about is how much we hurt. How we manage our pain is up to us. Pain. We anaesthetize, ride it out, embrace it, ignore it... and for some of us, the best way to manage pain is to just push through it.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Bring the Pain[2.5]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Cristina, Meredith and Izzie are tilting their heads, watching the porn playing for the patient] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : That does <i>  not </i> look comfortable.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Trust me, it's not.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Bring the Pain[2.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Pain, you just have to ride it out, hope it goes away on its own, hope the wound that caused it heals. There are no solutions, no easy answers. You just breathe deep and wait for it to subside. Most of the time pain can be managed, but sometimes the pain gets you when you least expect it, hits way below the belt and doesn't let up. Pain, you just have to fight through, because the truth is you can't outrun it, and life always makes more.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Into You like A Train[2.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you.</dd><dd> <b>  Burke </b> : What is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : I need to find this man's leg. The chief is going to kick me out of the program if I don't. I cannot go back to Los Angeles. It's sunny there. Every. Day.</dd><dd> <i>  [Burke smiles] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : What? You're my boyfriend! I mean, I know I don't have much experience with this kind of thing but, aren't boyfriends supposed to help in situations like this?</dd><dd> <b>  Burke </b> : Cristina, when we're on duty I can't be your boyfriend.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : OK, so when we're on duty, I can have sex with someone else?</dd><dd> <b>  Burke </b> : <i>  [pause] </i> Dr. Yang, I'm walking away now.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Into You like A Train[2.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> As surgeons, there are so many things we have to know. We have to know we have what it takes. We have to know how to take care of our patients... and how to take care of each other. Eventually, we even have to figure out how to take care of ourselves. As surgeons we have to be in the know. But as human beings, sometimes it's better to stay in the dark, because in the dark there may be fear, but there's also hope.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Something to Talk About[2.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Communication. It's the first thing we really learn in life. Funny thing is, once we grow up, learn our words and really start talking the harder it becomes to know what to say. Or how to ask for what we really need.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Something to Talk About[2.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : And you three--- brush up on how not to embarrass me in front of the Attendings or I'll see to it that your hearts stop beating. You clear?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Something to Talk About[2.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Alex </b> : For a kiss to be really good, you want it to mean something. You want it to be with someone you can't get out of your head, so that when your lips finally touch, you feel it everywhere. A kiss so hot and so deep, you never want to come up for air. You can't cheat your first kiss, Nicole. Trust me you don't want to, 'cause when you find that right person, the first kiss...it's everything.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Something to Talk About[2.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> At the end of the day, there are some things you just can't help but talk about. Some things we just don't want to hear, and some things we say because we can't be silent any longer. Some things are more than what you say, they're what you do. Some things you say because there's no other choice. Some things you keep to yourself. And not too often, but every now and then, some things simply speak for themselves.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Let It Be[2.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : You kissed me.</dd><dd> <b>  Alex  ' </b> : Yes, I did.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Should we?... I mean, there's a discussion that we could have... if you wanted to have one?</dd><dd> <b>  Alex </b> : Izzie, I kissed you, with tongue, and I plan to do it again and again - get used to it. End of discussion.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Let It Be[2.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Alex' </b> : <i>  [referring to a patient who is removing her breasts and ovaries to prevent possible cancer] </i> Here's the thing - I like your rack.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : God, what is wrong with you? Why do you have to be so - what is wrong with you?</dd><dd> <b>  Alex' </b> : I like your rack and I'd want them around if I could have them, trust me I would, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if you got rid of them... because really, I'd want you.</dd><dd> <i>  [Izzie slaps him] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Alex' </b> : Ow! What was that for?</dd><dd> <i>  [She kisses him] </i></dd></dl>
Season 2
Let It Be[2.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Maybe Romeo and Juliet were fated to be together, but just for a while, and then their time passed. If they could have known that beforehand, maybe it all would have been okay. I told Mrs. Snyder that when I was grown up, I'd take fate into my own hands. I wouldn't let some guy drag me down. Mrs. Snyder said that I'd be lucky if I ever had that kind of passion with someone, and that if I did, we'd be together forever. Even now, I believe that for the most part, love is about choices. It's about putting down the poison and the dagger and making your own happy ending...most of the time. And that sometimes, despite all your best choices and all your best intentions... fate wins anyway.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Thanks for the Memories[2.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Gratitude, appreciation, giving thanks. No matter what words you use, they all mean the same thing. Happy. We're supposed to be happy. Grateful for friends, family. Happy just to be alive. Whether we like it or not.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Thanks for the Memories[2.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cristina  ' </b> : <i>  [about inviting Burke to Thanksgiving dinner] </i> What was I supposed to do? Blow off my boyfriend for Thanksgiving? I tried to. He wouldn't blow. He's like something sticky that won't blow off.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Thanks for the Memories[2.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : I feel like one of those people who are so freaking miserable that they can't be around normal people. Like I'll infect the happy people. Like I'm some miserable, diseased, dirty ex-mistress.</dd><dd> <b>  Alex </b> : A miserable, diseased, dirty ex-mistress? <i>  [Wolf whistle] </i> That's hot. That's really hot. I feel better already.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Thanks for the Memories[2.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Maybe we're not supposed to be happy. Maybe gratitude has nothing to do with joy. Maybe being grateful means recognizing what you have for what it is. Appreciating small victories. Admiring the struggle it takes simply to be human. Maybe we're thankful for the familiar things we know. And maybe we're thankful for the things we'll never know. At the end of the day, the fact that we have the courage to still be standing is reason enough to celebrate.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Much Too Much[2.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> When you were a kid, it was Halloween candy. You hid it from your parents and you ate it until you got sick. In college, it was the heavy combo of youth, tequila and well, you know. As a surgeon, you take as much of the good as you can get because it doesn't come around nearly as often as it should. 'Cause good things aren't always what they seem. Too much of anything, even love, is not always a good thing.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Much Too Much[2.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Excuse me- what makes you think we can live together? You don't know anything about me.</dd><dd> <b>  Burke </b> : I know that you prefer an 11-blade for your IND's, I know you like your coffee from the cart by the front entrance better than the coffee in the cafeteria. I know you.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Those are little things, details.</dd><dd> <b>  Burke </b> : I know you. You don't want to move. But I can't always be the one that takes the step. Any more steps and I'm walking away.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Much Too Much[2.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> How do you know when how much is too much? Too much too soon. Too much information. Too much fun. Too much love. Too much to ask... And when is it all just too much to bear?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Forty years ago, the Beatles asked the world a simple question: they wanted to know where all the lonely people came from. My latest theory is that a great many of the lonely people come from hospitals. More precisely, the surgical wing of hospitals. As surgeons, we ignore our own needs so we can meet our patients' needs. We ignore our friends and families so we can save other people's friends and families. Which means that, at the end of the day, all we really have is ourselves. And nothing in this world can make you feel more alone than that.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : <i>  [about Alex] </i> He's unbelievable. I'm so glad I never slept with him. Which is his loss. Because I'm really good in bed. Mind blowing. Mind-blowingly good in bed.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Are you trying to seduce us?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : And he sleeps with Olivia, instead of me. Olivia?!</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Hey, I slept with Olivia.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Well, then you both have bad taste.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : You know, you can't say that you weren't warned. Alex has always been Alex.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : You dodged a bullet, Iz. You're better off without him.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Why are you even surprised? You sleep with a snake, you get bit.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Thanks, guys. . . for the support.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Cristina kicks Izzie awake.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Dammit, WHAT?!</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Hell hath no fury like a girl whose non-boyfriend screws a nurse.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : <i>  [under her breath] </i> Bitch.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : I like you bitter and pissed off. You're almost like a normal person now.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : These are preemies, they were supposed to spend another 8 weeks in the womb. Just like interns, they're not ready for the real world.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : So, you're giving up your trailer.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : I'm not giving up the trailer. Is Addison telling people that I'm giving up the trailer?</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : It's just funny, I just never would have pegged you for that guy.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : What guy?</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : You know, the marble bath, private pool, gated community guy.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Don't peg me. I'm not peggable.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : You're pegged. Deal with it.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : <i>  [about Alex] </i> I'm telling you, Meredith was all over him.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Seriously, she was all over him? What, like mounting him, with all the babies watching? Seriously?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Well, she would have been if I hadn't interrupted.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : She was talking to him.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : You don't talk to bastards who cheat on their girlfriends, George. That's the rule.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : You weren't officially his girlfriend.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : That's not the point.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : It is kind of the point. You don't see me getting all emotional over people I'm not dating.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Really?! You want to go there?!</dd><dd> <i>  [Ominous looks all around.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : I'M HAVING A MOMENT HERE. DON'T MESS WITH ME.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : You're not going to have a nervous breakdown and kill yourself, are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : No.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : So, there's no chance you'll kill us?</dd><dd> <i>  [Izzie storms out.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : OK, that was wrong on so many levels.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : When Derek broke up with you, I never once said that you were better off without him. It's not supportive, it's condescending. I was there for you, all I ever am is there for you guys, and the one time I need you? Just go away, Meredith.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Karl (Patient) </b> : <i>  [to George] </i> But sometimes, no matter how much you love someone, they just can't love you back in the same way. Believe me, son. Living with a woman who can't love you back ... way lonelier than being alone.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Owner of a Lonely Heart[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Four hundred years ago, another well-known English guy had an opinion on being alone. John Donne. He thought we were never alone. Of course it was fancier when he said it. No man is an island entire unto himself. Boil down that island talk and he just meant that all anyone needs is someone to step in and let us know we're not alone. And who's to say that someone can't have four legs. Someone to play with, or run around with, or just hang out.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> It's an urban myth that suicide rates spike at the holidays. Turns out they actually go down. Experts think it's because people are less inclined to off themselves when surrounded by family. Ironically, that same family togetherness is thought to be the reason that depression rates actually do spike at the holidays. Yeah, okay. Izzie doesn't count.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  George </b> : <i>  [about Dr. Bailey] </i> Look at her belly! She's almost as wide as she is tall!</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Are her ankles swollen? Is that why she's waddling?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : What's gonna happen to us when she goes on leave?</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Leave? She's going on leave?</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : What do you think happens when people push babies out of their vaginas?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Do you think we're gonna get a new resident?</dd><dd> <b>  Alex </b> : Nah, They'll probably just let us all walk around unattended, see how much damage we can do.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Yeah, well, you would know.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Justin's Mom </b> : You hear that, baby? Santa Claus is bringing you a new heart for Christmas.</dd><dd> <b>  Justin </b> : Well tell that fat ass to give it to someone else. I don't want it!</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Burke </b> : I believe there's a mind-body-spirit connection. And if Justin really doesn't want this heart, his body <i>  will </i> reject it.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Okay, let me get this straight. You don't just celebrate Christmas...you actually believe in Santa Claus?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  George </b> : Paging Dr. Karev-ian <i>  [laughter] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : What did you just say?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Ah-it, it's a joke, Kevorkian, Karev-ian...Alex Karev?</dd><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : I get the joke. I just don't think it's funny. You see this O'Malley? I make one mistake with this scalpel and this man's dead. My husband, he makes mistakes at his job all the time. As far as I know he's never killed anyone but I have. And YOU WILL. And Alex did. He made a math mistake and a man died for it. Run that past your accountant - see how he'd feel if every mistake he made, someone ended up dead. You don't have to like Alex, you don't have to care about him, but you damn well have to be on his side.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Do you know what time of year neurosurgeons are the busiest, Dr. Stevens?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : There's a time of year?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : There's no hard or fast rule, but brain injuries tend to pile up around the holidays. Like our friend here. Folks fall off their roofs while they string up lights, or when they go skating for the first time in a decade, break their heads open. And every year people drive through blizzards to get to parties where they kiss germ-infected strangers under poisonous mistletoe. And then they get so drunk that they smash their heads through their windshield on their way home. Like I said, there's no hard or fast rule.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Alex is practicing giving Cristina a breast exam, only it looks like he's groping her] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : OK, the way you're grabbing me right now, that's assault. <i>  [She takes his hand and demonstrates how to give a breast exam] </i> This is an exam. Pat, pat, pat. <i>  [George walks in and sees] </i></dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : What? What the hell? Does Izzie know? Does Burke know about this?</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Unbunch your panties, George, we're helping Alex study. <i>  [To Alex] </i> Do it.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : I can't hear you when his hand is on your boob.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Take your hand off my boob, Alex.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : I believe in medicine. And it's a medical miracle you're alive. And medicine is a lot cooler than Santa. So I'm just saying...I think you should decide to live. Live so you can become a doctor, and you can find a way to do heart transplants without someone having to die. Or, live so you can grow up and have kids and...Raise them not to believe in Santa. That would piss your mom off. Just decide to live. Because in your case, dying really isn't the best revenge.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : Okay, seriously, if you are that lonely, there are excellent vibrators. I can give you a catalogue.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : I'm not saying this to hurt you or because I want to leave you, because I don't. Meredith wasn't a fling. She wasn't revenge. I fell in love with her. That doesn't go away because I decided to stay with you.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> There's an old proverb that says you can't choose your family. You take what the fates hand you. And like them or not, love them or not, understand them or not, you cope. Then there's the school of thought that says the family you're born into is simply a starting point. They feed you, and clothe you, and take care of you until you're ready to go out into the world and find your tribe.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  George </b> : You know I would keep you here if I could.</dd><dd> <b>  Sophie </b> : No, darling, you can't waste any more time with me. You have to go balls out with the dog.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Excuse me?</dd><dd> <b>  Sophie </b> : So she chose an animal over you. Women are fools, that's old news. But life's too short for you to give in, Irish. So fight, you fight for what's yours.</dd></dl>

Tell Me Sweet Little Lies[2.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  George </b> <i>  [to Meredith] </i> : You don't get to choose. I know you've been going through a bad time. I know you miss Shepherd. And I know that your life has, admittedly, been pretty unpleasant these days. You get points for breathing in and out. You get to be a little selfish. But you don't get to choose a dog over me... I'm <i>  George </i> . I sleep down the hall from you. I buy your tampons. I have held your hand, every time you asked. I've earned the right to be seen. To be respected. To not have you think of me, as less than a dog that you got at the pound. So, I'm not moving out. Whether you like it or not, I'm staying.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Tell Me Sweet Little Lies[2.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> No matter how hard we try to ignore or deny it, eventually the lies fall away, whether we like it or not. But here's the truth about the truth: It hurts. So we lie.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Break On Through[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> In general, lines are there for a reason: for security, for clarity. If you choose to cross the line, you pretty much do so at your own risk. So why is it, that the bigger the line, the greater the temptation to cross it?</dd></dl>

Break On Through[2.15]

<dl><dd> <b>  Chief </b> : We need an additional 40 nurses to relieve the overtime that they're striking about. That's 2 million dollars a year we don't have.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Have you checked under the couch? I always find spare change under the cushions.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sydney </b> : <i>  [about Cristina, who wants to remove the patient's leg] </i> And when I do, our eager young intern here can hold the saw. Unlike Dr. Karev, kindness and compassion aren't very high on her list of priorities, but a little bone-saw action? Maybe that will earn me some respect, am I right?</dd></dl>

But...still. Something inside us decides to do a crazy thing. A thing we know will probably turn around and bite us in the ass. Yet, we do it anyway. What I'm saying is...we reap what we sow. what comes around goes around. It's karma and, any way you slice it...karma sucks.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  George </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> One way or another our karma will leave us to face ourselves. We can look our karma in the eye or we can wait for it to sneak up on us from behind. One way or another, our karma will always find us. And the truth is, as surgeons, we have more chances than most to set the balance in our favor. No matter how hard we try we can't escape our karma. It follows us home. I guess we can't really complain about our karma. It's not unfair. It's not unexpected. It just...evens the score. And even when we're about to do something we know will tempt karma to bite us in the ass...well, it goes without saying. We do it anyway.</dd></dl>

Superstition[2.21]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Superstition lies in the space between what we can control and what we can't. Find a penny, pick it up, and all day long you'll have good luck. No one wants to pass up a chance for good luck. But does saying it thirty three times really help? Is anyone really listening? And if no ones listening, why do we bother doing those strange things. We rely on superstitions because we're smart enough to know we don't have all the answers. And that life works in mysterious ways. Don't diss the juju, from wherever it comes.</dd></dl>

And there are those of us who love to play a little too much.</dd></dl>

Do your research.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Well, if all the normal methods have failed then what are we supposed to do?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Use a strobe light. Get her drunk. Hang her up upside down from the ceiling and hit her with a wiffle ball bat, for all I care. Just make her seize.

High horses want nothing to do with me. With you and Izzie, it's, there are strict rules about doctors dating patients.</dd><dd> <b>  Denny </b> : You know Izzie pretty well, right? You think if I went to her and I said "Hey, you know, this is gonna be pretty bad for your career, you probably shouldn't come around and see me anymore." You think that will have any effect at all? The thing is, I was healthy my whole life till I wasn't. And the last year I've had a lot of time to lie around in bed and think about my life.

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> In life we are taught that there are seven deadly sins. We all know the big ones... gluttony, pride, lust. But the thing you don't hear much about is anger. Maybe it's because we think anger is not that dangerous, that you can control it. My point is, maybe we don't give anger enough credit. Maybe it can be a lot more dangerous than we think. After all, when it comes to destructive behavior, it did make the top seven.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> So what makes anger different from the six other deadly sins? It's pretty simple really, you give into a sin like envy or pride and you only hurt yourself. Try lust or coveting and you'll only hurt yourself and one or two others.

Season 3
Sometimes a Fantasy[3.3]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> The fantasy is simple. Pleasure is good, and twice as much pleasure is better. That pain is bad, and no pain is better. But the reality is different. The reality is that pain is there to tell us something, and there's only so much pleasure we can take without getting a stomach ache. And maybe that's okay. Maybe some fantasies are only supposed to live in our dreams.</dd></dl>

If you ask them, they'll tell you they want to be general surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons. Distinctions which do more than describe their area of expertise, they define who they are, because outside the operating room, not only do most surgeons have no idea who they are, they're also afraid to find out.</dd></dl>

It turns out, sometimes you have to do the wrong thing. Sometimes you have to make a big mistake to figure out how to make things right. Mistakes are painful, but they're the only way to find out who you really are. I know who I am now. I know what I want. I've got the love of my life, a new heart and I want you guys to get on the next plane out here and meet my girl. Everything's gonna be different now, I promise.

Trying to make it work with Addison and you could have been with Meredith. That you could be happy right now. That all this, everything. That you and Meredith could have had a real chance. Still, I thought you should know the truth. Thought I owed you that, as a friend.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : You're not my friend.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Oh, the Guilt[3.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> First do no harm, easier said than done. We can take all the oaths in the world, but the fact is, most of us do harm all the time. Sometimes even when we're trying to help, we do more harm than good. And then the guilt rears its ugly head. What you do with that guilt is up to you. We're left with a choice. Either let the guilt throw you back into the behavior that got you into trouble in the first place, or learn from the guilt and do your best to move on.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Callie </b> : <i>  [to George] </i> I'm out of my element here, I break bones for a living, I used to live in the basement, most days I wear last night's eyeliner to work, and I don't give a crap about what other people think of me.

So please, don't chase me anymore, unless you're ready to catch me.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Let The Angels Commit[3.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> There are times when even the best of us have trouble with commitment, and we may be surprised at the commitments we're willing to let slip out of our grasp. Commitments are complicated. We may surprise ourselves by the commitments we're willing to make. True commitment, takes effort, and sacrifice. Which is why sometimes, we have to learn the hard way, to choose our commitments very carefully.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> As surgeons, we are trained to look for disease. Sometimes the problem is easily detected, most of the time we need to go step by step. First, probing the surface looking for any sign of trouble. Most of the time, we can't tell what's wrong with somebody by just looking at them. After all, they can look perfectly fine on the outside, while their insides tell a whole other story.</dd></dl>

Where the Boys Are[3.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Not all wounds are superficial. Most wounds run deeper than you can imagine. You can't see them with the naked eye.

So this thing where we all keep our distance and pretend not to care about each other, it's usually a load of bull. So we pick and choose who we want to remain close to, and once we've chosen those people, we tend to stick close by. No matter how much we hurt them. The people that are still with you at the end of the day, those are the ones worth keeping. And sure, sometimes close can be too close. But sometimes, that invasion of personal space, it can be exactly what you need.</dd></dl>

People die in front of us everyday, but I believe Meredith will survive this. I believe, I believe, I...I believe in the good. I believe that it's been a hell of a year and I believe that in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary we will all be okay. I believe a lot of things. I believe that...I believe that Denny is always with me. And I believe that if I eat a tub of butter and no one sees me the calories don't count. And I believe that surgeons who prefer staples over stitches are just lazy. I believe that you are a man that made a terrible mistake marrying Callie and I believe that because I'm your best friend I can tell you this and we can be okay. I believe that even though you made this mistake you will be okay. I believe we survive, George. I believe that believing we survive is what makes us survive.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Some Kind of Miracle[3.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> There are medical miracles. Being worshippers of the altar of science, we don't like to believe miracles exist. But they do. Things happen. We can't explain them, we can't control them, but they do happen. Miracles do happen in medicine. They happen everyday, just not always when we need them to happen.</dd></dl>

Because George's Dad died, because Izzie lost me, and Cristina, when she was nine she was in a car accident with her Father and he bled out right in front of her while they waited for an ambulance to arrive, and Alex...</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Stop!</dd><dd> <b>  Denny </b> : They are barely breathing, this will break them, and none of them deserves that. And this, this is the big one, so you pay attention. Do you know what kind of miracle it is that Derek is who he is? Do you know how rare it is that someone like him even exists? He's still an optimist. He still believes in true love and magic and soul mates. He's waiting for you, and if you don't come back from this...you will change who he is.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Oh, God...</dd></dl>
Season 3
Scars and Souvenirs[3.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> People have scars. In all sorts of unexpected places. Like secret road maps of their personal histories. Diagrams of all their old wounds.

Scars and Souvenirs[3.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> What's worse, new wounds which are so horribly painful or old wounds that should've healed years ago and never did? Maybe our old wounds teach us something. They remind us where we've been and what we've overcome. They teach us lessons about what to avoid in the future. That's what we like to think. But that's not the way it is, is it? Some things we just have to learn over and over and over again.</dd></dl>
Season 3
My Favorite Mistake[3.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Surgeons always have a plan. Where to cut, where to clamp, where to stitch. But, even with the best plans complications can arise, things can go wrong. And suddenly, you're caught with your pants down.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Hours. Hours of out life that are all I can think about and you seriously can't remember?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Look, Izzie, I was drunk!. Whatever I did, whatever I said, I'm sure I didn't mean it.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Yes George, you meant it. You meant it a lot. You meant it more than once.</dd></dl>
Season 3
My Favorite Mistake[3.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : What she was afraid of was that you were taking on so much of her disease that you were freezing up too. You've spent so much time planning and helping her progress, God knows that's what you should've been doing, but she was worried. You have a healthy body Nina, if you fall down you won't turn to stone. And your mom so wanted you to just let yourself fall. Messing up, it's what makes a person, it's how we learn, where we find joy. And the things you don't plan for, are the things you never see coming.</dd></dl>
Season 3
My Favorite Mistake[3.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : OK it happened, it was a mistake and it happened. People make mistakes. We need to figure out where we go from here we need to figure out how we tell Callie.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : I'm not going to tell Callie. Do you know how much this would hurt her? I'm not going to clear my conscience at her expense. She has done nothing but support me and encourage me and believe in me and this is how I pay her back. I have to live with what I did. This is our secret. OK?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : OK</dd></dl>
Season 3
My Favorite Mistake[3.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> The thing about plans is they don't take into account the unexpected, so when we're thrown a curve ball, whether its in the OR or in life, we have to improvise. Of course, some of us are better at it than others. Some of us just have to move on to plan B and make the best of it. And sometimes what we want is exactly what we need. But sometimes, sometimes what we need is a new plan.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Time After Time[3.20]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> A patient's history is as important as their symptoms. It's what helps us decide if heart burn's a heart attack... if a head ache's a tumor. Sometimes patients will try to re-write their own histories. They'll claim they don't smoke, or forget to mention certain drugs... which in surgery can be the kiss of death. We can ignore it all we want, but our history eventually always comes back to haunt us.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : <i>  [to George] </i> You don't have to keep avoiding me.</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Yeah I do, until this thing blows over, I do. <i>  [to people in the clinic] </i> Javier Jugerreo? Javier Jugerreo?</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Blows over? What does that even mean?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : When Meredith and I uh, eventually it blew over, the past.</dd><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : You mean the sad sex? The sad, tragic, depression-inducing sex you had with Meredith is the same as what we-</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : I can't. Back off. Just for now...back off.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : See now you can't do that!</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Do what?</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Not look happy after sex. It's bad for the ego.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : I'm fine.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Are <i>  we </i> fine?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Sure</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Not so convincing. I shouldn't have accused you of hovering. It wasn't nice, you were just trying to be there for me. But now I'm being available, and communicating, and getting naked, and doing all of your favorite things.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Good things.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : Then why are you still staring at the ceiling?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : I don't know, it's just, that day, you came out of the water. I spent the scariest hour of my life, trying to breathe for you. I love you, and I want you, but I don't know what to...you didn't swim. You didn't swim and you know how to. And I don't know if I can... I don't know if I wanna keep trying to breathe for you.</dd><dd> <i>  [pause] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : I should go. I'll go.</dd></dl>

Season 3
The Other Side of This Life[3.22 &amp; 3.23]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Maybe we accept the dream has become a nightmare. We tell ourselves that reality is better. We convince ourselves it's better that we never dream at all. But, the strongest of us, the most determined of us, holds on to the dream or we find ourselves faced with a fresh dream we never considered. We wake to find ourselves, against all odds, feeling hopeful. And, if we're lucky, we realize in the face of everything, in the face of life the true dream is being able to dream at all.</dd></dl>

And you don't complain.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : On call rooms. Sleep when you can, where you can. You know, but not with anybody. Not attendings, especially not attendings. Sleeping with attendings, not a good idea. Where was I?</dd><dd> <b>  George </b> : Er, rule number three. If you're sleeping, do not wake you unless the patient is actually dying.</dd><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : The dying patient better not be dead when I get there, because not only will you have killed someone, you will have woken me for no good reason.

It would be too easy if it were just drugs and booze and cigarettes. I think the hardest part of kicking a habit is wanting to kick it. I mean, we get addicted for a reason, right? Often, too often, things that start out as just a normal part of your life at some point cross the line to obsessive, compulsive, out of control.

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> The truth is painful. Deep down nobody wants to hear it, especially when it hits close to home. Sometimes we tell the truth because the truth is all we have to give. Sometimes we tell the truth because we need to say it out loud to hear it for ourselves. And sometimes we tell the truth because we just can't help ourselves. Sometimes, we tell them, because we owe them at least that much.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> In life only one thing is certain, apart from death and taxes: No matter how hard you try, no matter how good your intentions, you are going to make mistakes. You are going to hurt people. You are going to get hurt. And if you ever want to recover, theres really only one thing you can say...</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Izzie </b> : Callie, Callie wait, please, wait. I'm sorry about the cafeteria. I didn't think you wanted to talk to me. I thought you wanted to kill me. I'm sorry about everything...with George, I...I'm really sorry. I feel terrible.</dd><dd> <b>  Callie </b> : You feel terrible? You took advantage, he was your best friend. I tried to trust you. So much that I convinced myself that it was all in my head, that I was crazy. But I wasn't, was I? And then you pulled that thing in the cafeteria today. It's not bad enough that you humiliate me by getting in bed with my husband, you have to humiliate me at work too. George may be the one who broke his vows but you...we're women, Izzie. You did this to another woman. You took something from me. You stole something from me like a petty little thief. YOU are the one who should be humiliated. YOU are the one who should be ashamed. You are the one...don't you dare come to me for forgiveness you traitorous bitch.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : So, I got Alex to cover for me so I can leave right after I round on my patients... 48 uninterrupted hours!</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Yeah, yeah, yeah... um... you know, maybe this is not a good weekend.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : What did Lexie say about me?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : She didn't say anything.

I mean, you talked to the other Grey about me?</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : You know what I talked about with the other Grey?

I want a lifetime.</dd><dd> ( <i>  Meredith steps back a little </i> )</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Mm. See what happens? I say things like that, and you fight the urge to run in the opposite direction. It's ok. I understand. I didn't, but now I do. I do. You're just getting started and I've been doing this for a long time. Deep down, you're still an intern, and you're not ready.</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : I'm not ready right now. But things can stay the way they are, and I can get ready. I'll get ready.</dd><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : Things can stay the way they are.

Season 4
The Heart of the Matter[4.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Forgive and forget. That's what they say. It's good advice, but it's not very practical. When someone hurts us, we want to hurt them back. When someone wrongs us, we want to be right. Without forgiveness old scores never settle. Old wounds never heal, and the most we can hope for is that someday we'll be lucky enough to forget.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Haunt You Every Day[4.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> It isn't just surgeons. I don't know anyone who isn't haunted by something or someone. And whether we try to slice the pain away with a scalpel or shove it in the back of a closet- our efforts usually fail. So the only way we can clear out the cobwebs is to turn a new page or put an old story to rest- finally, finally to rest.</dd></dl>

Season 4
Kung Fu Fighting[4.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> (voiceover): Deep down, everyone wants to believe they can be hardcore. But being hardcore isn't just about being tough - it's about acceptance. Sometimes you have to give yourself permission to not be hardcore for once. You don't have to be tough every minute of every day. It's okay to let down your guard. In fact, there are moments when it's the best thing you can possibly do - as long as you choose your moments wisely.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction[4.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> (voiceover): Before we were doctors, we were med students, which meant we spend a lot of time of studying chemistry. Organic chemistry, biochemistry, we learned it all.

But in reality I just wanna say, "Izzie, just because you <i>  can </i> do that with your legs doesn't mean that you <i>  should </i> .</dd><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : [Winces and sticks her finger in her ear] Eh...

And... and two, I can draw really, really well on an etch a sketch. Like, really well, like I could be a professional if, you know, that profession existed. I play the trombone... badly. Uh, I like Math. And I notice that you do this thing with your hands when you're trying to make a point, like... like... like this. And I know that that's about you, but I ... I do it, too.

And he wasn't actually a problem, he was kinda charming. But, he seemed very sad and I'd hate to see it happen again so maybe you should think about keeping a better eye on him.</dd><dd> <b>  Lexie </b> : Everyday is my mother's birthday. My mother was born in March. He lied. He's a liar. And I'm glad. Really, I'm glad that you found him charming. I'm sure he was delightful. He's a blast after five drinks, not so much after nine though; he gets a little weepy and mean. He's a drunk, Meredith. He probably came in and told you how wonderful you are. How sad he is he doesn't get to spend more time with you. You know, yesterday he told me I was his favorite daughter. The day before, I was an ungreatful bitch. The week before, he wrote me a check for twenty-thousand dollars because he said I deserved everything life had to offer because he was so proud of me, a lifetimes worth of proud. So thank you for letting me know that I need to keep a better eye on him. Thanks.</dd><dd> ( <i>  Lexie storms away.

Crash Into Me, Part One[4.9]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> We go into medicine because we want to save lives. We go into medicine because we want to do good. We go into medicine for the rush... for the high... for the ride. But, what we rememeber at the end of most days are the losses. What we lay awake at night replaying is the pain we caused or failed to cure. The lives we ruined or failed to save. So the experience of practicing medicine rarely resembles the goal. The experience too often is ass backwards and upsidedown.</dd></dl>

The problem is, fairy tales don't come true. It's the other stories, the ones that begin with dark and stormy nights and end in the unspeakable.

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> In 6500 BC, some guy looked at his friend and said, let's drill a hole in your head... that will make you feel better. And thus surgery was born. It takes a certain brand of crazy to think of drilling into someone's skull, but surgeons have always been a confident bunch. We don't always know what we're doing, but we act like we do. We walk into a country, plant a flag and start ordering people around. It's invigorating and terrifying.</dd></dl>

Brave New World[5.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> We like to think we're fearless, eager to explore unknown lands and soak up new experiences, but the fact is, we're always terrified. Maybe the terror is part of the attraction. Some people go to horror movies. We cut things open. Dive into dark water. And at the end of the day, isn't that what you'd rather to hear about? If you've got one drink and one friend and 45 minutes. Slow rides make for boring stories. A little calamity. Now that's worth talking about.</dd></dl>

There's No "I" In Team[5.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I am a rock. I am an island. That's the mantra to pretty much every surgeon that I've ever met. We like to think we're independent. Loners. Mavericks. That all we need to do our jobs is an OR, a scalpel, and a willing body...But the truth is, not even the best of us can do it alone. Surgery, like life, is a team sport...and eventually, you've gotta get off the bench and decide... which team are you batting for.</dd></dl>

There's right, and there's wrong. And this, was wrong. And illegal. There is no gray area here. You can't kind of think this is okay. You can't kind of side with Izzie Stevens.

Invasion[6.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Arizona </b> : Most people think that I was named for the state, but it's not true, I was named for a battle ship. The U.S.S. Arizona. My grandfather was serving on the Arizona when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and he saved nineteen men before he drowned. Pretty much everything my father did his whole life was about honoring that sacrifice. I was raised to be a good man in a storm. Raised to love my country. Love my family. Protect the things I love. When my father, Colonel Daniel Robinson of the United States Marine Corps, heard that I was a lesbian he said he only had one question. I was prepared for "How fast can you get the hell out of my house?" But instead, it was "Are you still who I raised you to be?" My father believes in country the way that you believe in God. And my father is not a man who bends, but he bent for me because I am his daughter. I'm a good man in a storm. I love your daughter. And I protect the things I love. Not that I need too, she doesn't need it. She's strong, and caring, and honorable. And she's who you raised her to be.</dd></dl>

I'm saying you should look again at who is responsible.</dd></dl>

I Saw What I Saw[6.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> When we're headed toward an outcome that's too horrible to face, that's when we go looking for a second opinion. And sometimes, the answer we get just confirms our worst fears. But sometimes, it can shed new light on the problem, make you see it in a whole new way. After all the opinions have been heard and every point of view has been considered, you finally find what you're after - the truth. But the truth isn't where it ends, that's just where you begin again with a whole new set of questions.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Give Peace A Chance[6.7]
<dl><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Ask most surgeons why they became surgeons and they usually tell you the same thing. It was for the high, the rush, the thrill that comes from cutting someone open and saving their life. For me it was different, maybe it was because I grew up in a house with four sisters. No, definitely because I grew up in a house with four sisters because it was the quiet that drew me to surgery. The operating room is a quiet place. Peaceful. It has to be in order for us to stay alert, anticipate complications. When you stand in the OR, your patient open on the table, all the worlds noise, all the worry that it brings disappears. A calm settles over you, time passing without thought. For that moment, you feel completely at peace.</dd></dl>

This is America. And I will do what needs to be done. So you can kiss my hard-core, diaper wearing ass.</dd></dl>

Invest in Love[6.8]
<dl><dd> <b>  Arizona </b> : This is not general surgery on a miniature scale. These are the tiny humans. These are children. They believe in magic. They play pretend. There is fairy dust in their IV bags. They hope, and they cross their fingers, and they make wishes, and that makes them more resilient than adults. They recover faster, survive worse. They believe.</dd></dl>

And today, Miranda, I sat in the gallery, and I watched you repair some fat man's hernia. And for the first time in my life, I felt ashamed of you. This is what you do on Christmas? For this you traded your husband? For this, you traded your child's family? So you can work all day, and go home alone, on Christmas, to an empty house, without even a tree. I have been a proud father, Miranda, but I would be a bad father today if I didn't look you in the eye and tell you that you have made a terrible mistake.

That is not what I want him to believe married love is. And I know what's possible, I know what's out there for me because you taught me well. You and mom showed me what true love looks like, so I chose not to settle, and I'm happier for it. Even if I'm alone at Christmas. My child is healthy, and I'm happy. --You know, part of my happiness is the fact that I got to repair a woman's bowel and save her life today. And that's God's work, which makes this an appropriate Christmas dinner conversation. --I'm happy, and my child is healthy, and that's enough for me today, Dad. That's enough.</dd></dl>

Blink[6.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> We assume the really serious changes in our lives happen slowly, over time. But it's not true. The big stuff happens in an instant. Becoming an adult, becoming a parent, becoming a doctor: one minute you're not and the next, you are. Ask any doctor and they can point to the one moment they became a physician. It usually isn't med school graduation day. Wherever it is, nobody forgets it. Sometimes you don't even know anything is changed. You think you're still you and your life is still your life, but you wake up one day and look around, and you don't recognize anything, not anything at all.</dd></dl>

People call me the Nazi, and it's not because of my ice blue eyes. I spend 12 hours a day carving people up, and I like it. I have a child and I have no room for casual anything. I'm angry all of the time and deeply confused because a lot of people in my life have let me down recently, one of them was me. It's devastating but not completely because it turns I like sleeping crosswise in the bed and not have shaving my legs. My three year old used to be potty-trained and now he isn't because his father no longer lives with us and his world no longer make sense and the only thing he thinks he can control is his bladder, so he urinates. In a lot of places you wish he wouldn't urinate. You want lunch, or you wanna show me the scan?</dd></dl>

I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked[6.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Number one rule of surgery is limit exposure. Keep your hands clean, your incisions small, and your wounds covered. Number two rule of surgery is when rule number one stops working, try something else. Because sometimes you can't limit exposure, sometimes the injury is so bad you have to cut, and cut big.</dd></dl>

But now after all of it, I know that I'm a good man and I thank you for that. Because I know now that I'm good enough not to deserve this. Not to have to feel like this.

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> In surgery, the healing process begins with a cut, an incision, the tearing of flesh. We have to damage the healthy flesh in order to expose the unhealthy. It feels cruel and against common sense, but it works. You risk exposure for the sake of healing, and when it's over, once the incision has been closed, you wait. You wait and hope that your patient will heal. That you haven't in fact, just made everything worse.</dd></dl>
Season 6
State Of Love And Trust[6.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Derek </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> We ask a lot of our patients. We put them to sleep. Cut them open. Poke around in their brain and guts with sharp instruments. We ask for their blind trust. Irony is, trust is hard for surgeons, because we're trained from day one that we can't trust anyone but ourselves. The only instincts you can count on are your own. The only skills you can count on are your own. Until one day, you leave the classroom and step into the O.R. You're surrounded by others, a team of others. A team that you have to rely on whether you trust them or not.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : I know that you're new here, I know that you probably still have a chip on your shoulder because your parking space at Mercy West was better and I know that you're an anesthesiologist, which means you make buckets of money logging reasonable hours sitting on your behind and flipping through "Architectural Digest" while somebody on the other side of the curtain does the real work and gets sued for it.</dd><dd> <b>  Ben </b> : Excuse me. You have no idea-</dd><dd> <b>  Bailey </b> : I don't know what they did at Mercy West, but here at Seattle Grace, we expect to be able to trust the gas man, trust him to do his job so that we can do ours. We expect the gas man to stay awake at the switch no matter how long and boring a procedure might be. We expect the gas man to stay focused enough to keep the patient unconscious!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Cristina </b> : <i>  [to Owen] </i> Burke was- He took something from me. He took little pieces of me, little pieces over time, so small I didn't even notice, you know? He wanted me to be something I wasn't, and I made myself into what he wanted. One day I was me Cristina Yang, and then suddenly I was lying for him, and jeopardizing my career, and agreeing to be married and wearing a ring, and being a bride. Until I was standing there in a wedding dress with no eyebrows, and I wasn't Cristina Yang anymore. And even then, I would've married him. I would have. I lost myself for a long time. And now that I'm finally me again, I can't. I love you. I love you more than I loved Burke. I love you. And that scares the crap out of me because when you asked me to ignore Teddy's page, you took a piece of me, and I let you. And that will never happen again.</dd></dl>

I don't expect to win your trust overnight. But I want each of you to know you have mine. Which is why I felt it was important to personally come in here and apologize. I am neither pro nor anti merger. From this point on, everyone has a clean slate. I am not focused on the past. I'm looking to the future to all the promise this hospital has to offer. I plan to honor Richard Webber and his legacy, not undo it, which is why I'm both humbled and honored to be your new Chief of Surgery.</dd></dl>

Valentine's Day Massacre[6.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> The surgical scalpel is made of sterilized, carbonized stainless steel. This is a vast improvement over the first scalpel, which was pretty much a sharp stick. Medicine is constantly reinventing itself, that means surgeons have to keep reinventing themselves too. There's constant pressure to adapt to changes. It can be a painful process. But without it, you'll find yourself moving backwards instead of forwards.</dd></dl>
Season 6
Valentine's Day Massacre[6.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> We have to keep reinventing ourselves almost every minute because the world can change in an instant, and there's no time for looking back. Sometimes the changes are forced on us, sometimes they happen by accident, and we make the most of them. We have to constantly come up with new ways to fix ourselves. So we change, we adapt, we create new versions of ourselves. We just need to be sure that this one is an improvement over the last.</dd></dl>

I will respect the secrets that are confided in me, even after my patient has died. I will maintain by all the means in my power, the honor and the noble traditions of the medical profession. My colleagues will be my sisters and brothers. I will not permit considerations of age, disease or disability, creed, ethnic origin, gender, race, political affiliation, nationality, sexual orientation, social standing or any other fact to intervene between my duty and my patient. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life. I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat.

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Psychologists believe that every aspect of our lives, all our thought processes &amp; behavior patterns, are the direct result of our relationship to our parents. That every relationship that we have is really just another version of that first relationship. It's just us trying over &amp; over again to get it right.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Meredith </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> It's the most important job in the world. You probably should need a license to do it, but then most of us wouldn't even pass the written exam. Some people are naturals. They were born to do it. Some have other gifts. But the good news is biology dictates you don't have to do it alone. You can waste your whole life wondering, but the only way to find out what kind of parent you'd be is to finally stop talking about it and just do it.</dd></dl>
