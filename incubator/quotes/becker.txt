<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> You know what's killing this country? TV talk shows. I watched one last night. I should've just stuck a fork in my eye. You know, it's like America stepped in something and is scraping it off its shoe directly over my TV set. I'm telling you. Jerry Springer , Jenny Jones , they're all broadcasting straight from Hell! When I watched one the other day... I don't even know what the hell it was. Apparently, some guy wanted to be a woman, so he chops it off. Then he decides he likes chicks after all, so he becomes a lesbian. Tell me there's not a wasted step in there somewhere.</dd></dl>

He leaves the TV on so he <i>  can </i> get upset!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> Nobody called on you. It doesn't matter if you turn the set off. The people are still in there! And, frankly, I like knowing what they're up to. Trust me on this one. White trash is the <i>  only </i> natural resource this country will never run out of!</dd></dl>

The only seat I could find was next to some guy who claims he's Moses . He may well have been, too. He smelled like some guy who'd been dead for 3,000 years.</dd></dl>

Another Tricky Day
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> Mr. Garland, I understand--</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Garland: </b> No, you don't understand. When I left your office that day, I was devastated. But then I figured if I've only got a short time to live, well, I'm going to go out in style. The first thing I did was quit my job, told my boss to go straight to hell. What'd I have to lose? <i>  You </i> told me I was dying.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> I-I understand, but that's still just a job, you know? So you burned a bridge.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Garland: </b> No. I burned his new BMW.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> Why would you do that?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Garland: </b> Because you told me I was dying!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> Couldn't you pay him back?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Garland: </b> No, I can't. I spent all my money on champagne, limos and lap dances.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> <i>  All </i> of it?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Garland: </b> I got a <i>  lot </i> of lap dances.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> So, you spent all your money, and you lost your job, but all those things are fixable.</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Garland: </b> No. I haven't finished yet. After that, I maxed out my credit cards, cursed out my wife, and sent a photo copy of my ass to the IRS.</dd></dl>

They made a mistake once--</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Garland: </b> There's a chance I might not make it?!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> I promise I will exhaust ever possibility, but I'm only human, you know?

<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm beginning to think that Linda was right about all that astrology crap.</dd><dd> <b>  Margaret </b> : Oh, that's nonsense.

He played in the National Championships like, three different times.</dd><dd> <b>  Bob: </b> Excuse me?!</dd><dd> <b>  Jake Malinak: </b> Well, I only won once.</dd><dd> <b>  Bob: </b> Jake, you hustled us!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> Well, now technically, it's not hustling unless you were dumb enough to play for money.</dd><dd> <b>  Bob: </b> I thought it was a sure thing!

Mercury doesn't go into retrograde for another three months.</dd><dd> <b>  Linda </b> : Wow, that must mean that all the weird stuff that happened here today was nothing but a bunch of unrelated coincidences.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Yeah, you got a better explanation?</dd><dd> <b>  Linda </b> : Well, if you add up the month, the day and the year, that adds up to 26. You add the two and the six, that's eight. Divide that by four, that's two, which is the number of people here in this room. Coincidence? I don't think so.</dd></dl>

I know he is.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> All right, get down. Get down. If it'll make you feel better, I'll go take a look.</dd><dd> <b>  Margaret: </b> All right.</dd><dd> <i>  (Becker climbs a ladder to look above the ceiling panels) </i></dd><dd> <b>  Margaret: </b> You see anything?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker: </b> <i>  (A huge rat shadow suddenly passes by him) </i> Oh.

Chock Full 'O Nuts
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Look, someone in your department shut down a residential care facility in my neighborhood and threw everyone out into the street. Now I'm here because I want something done about it!</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : Wow. You sound pretty upset.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Well, I am. You know, I've been on the phone all afternoon calling every city agency I can think of, and all I got was the typical beureaucratic runaround.</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : Well that's terrible, you shouldn't have been treated like that.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : At least you see that.</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : Well of course I do!</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Then you'll help me?</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : Oh dear no.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : ...Well, maybe you didn't understand me...</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : No, I understood you perfectly. You've discovered a social injustice, and as a concerned citizen you've come to your government to demand some action.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Exactly!</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : It's not gonna happen. But that look on your face, oh, that took me back! What was that, righteous indignation? I used to feel like that when I first started working here forty-two years ago.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Yeah, well - you've been in this office forty-two years?</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : Yeah. Same desk, same fake plant, same window. Doesn't open. None of them do. Otherwise we'd all jump out. But you were saying?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Look, I told you! Either reopen the facility, or make some arrangements to take care of these people!</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : And I told you, I can't help.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : But you're the deputy secretary of social services!</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : It's just a title.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. John Becker </b> : Dammit! Look, listen - you're in charge here, you're responsible, you work for the city!</dd><dd> <b>  Deputy Secretary </b> : You're not listening! I can't help. Nobody can help. That facility is not going to reopen, and I'll tell you why: there is no money! There's no money because the federal government cut taxes, which is all anybody seems to care about anymore. That means less money for the state, which means less money for the city, which means we had to cut services, which means fewer cops, fewer firemen, bad air, bad water and crappy schools which will turn out another generation of voters too stupid and greedy to care about anything else besides cutting taxes! So don't you come in here and tell me to fix your problem, because there's not a DAMN THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT!... Where did that come from?</dd></dl>
