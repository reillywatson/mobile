This night, especially.</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : Halloween.</dd><dd> <b>  Bridget: </b> : In the Old Religion they call it Samhain.

Let some light in on the dark places. You know what she means to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Father: </b> :I do. I also know the danger of confusing the magic with the magician. Sometimes the person is smaller than the work, weaker, more frightened... more human. And I don't want to see you hurt, disappointed.</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : She will not disappoint me. Our lives are very different, but I am sure we will understand each other... I will not miss this opportunity. I must see her, talk to her.</dd></dl>

I can't pull back now-it would compromise everything-me, the case, even what you think of me. I have a chance to bring down the men responsible for all of this.

The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : What happened?</dd><dd> <b>  Father: </b> : What happened? I don't know.

We have looked in on you from time to time.</dd><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> : Your compassion will kill you one day, Jacob.</dd><dd> <b>  Father: </b> : It wasn't compassion. It was self-interest-making sure you didn't try to return.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> : So they call you Father now. I heard it through the pipes. Ingenious idea, communicating on those pipes.</dd><dd> <b>  Father: </b> : Yes, it was ingenious...of you, John.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> :'Father.'...I imagine you like that. It gives you all the authority you need, without making you sound like a despot...But underneath everything, you're no different from me.</dd><dd> <b>  Father: </b> : I am different.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> : What was your little idea? A family of individuals...living according to a higher standard. How uninspired, Jacob, how small-minded. We could have been gods, you and I.</dd></dl>

Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : We are all agreed that what is at stake here is the greater good of both worlds. Some coarse of action, anything, is better then to allow all that we are, all that we have built be held hostage to one man's evil.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Father: </b> : What do you propose?</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : I can stop Paracelsus from leaving the tunnels with his poison...It will give us time to decide on a more permanent solution.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Father: </b> : to Catherine I can't let you go close to him; he's unpredictable. I thought perhaps...if he heard your voice-the empathic connection that you share might somehow get through to him.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Catherine: </b> : What is it, Vincent? What are you thinking?</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : How ashamed I am, that you saw me as I was. How grateful I am that you were there. You saved my life, Catherine.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : You can't understand how I feel.</dd><dd> <b>  Father: </b> : It is not your responsibility to decide...</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : It is mine!

How can I explain...become disconnected...as if the dark side of your imagination eclipses all compassion, all dignity...I must go...</dd></dl>

The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : Paracelsus.</dd><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> : Vincent.</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : You know my name?</dd><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> : I know more about you than you think...</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : I don't wish to harm you. But you must leave this place.</dd><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> : Leave? By whose judgment?</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : Mine</dd><dd> <b>  Paracelsus: </b> : What does Falstaff say? That "the better part of valor is discretion"? Of course I will. I will do as you say. But wouldn't you like to hear me first? Or are you content to accept Father's story? Found as a babe outside St. Vincent's hospital? Did you really believe that all these years?...I know the truth. Aren't you at all curious to know why you are the way you are?</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Alchemist
<dl><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : Catherine, I understand why you expose yourself to danger.</dd><dd> <b>  Catherine: </b> : Because there are some risks worth taking.</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : And there are some things worth risking everything for.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Temptation
<dl><dd> <b>  Mouse: </b> : What's it like, Vincent, to have a love?</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : People have been searching for the words for centuries.

It reminds me of a piece of eternity.</dd><dd> <b>  Catherine: </b> :I'll cherish it...I wanted you to have a part of me to hold close. When I was little, I was terrified of the dark, and I used to have an awful time falling asleep. My mother gave me this rose, and she told me that, whenever I got frightened, to hold the rose, and think of her, and to know that wherever she was, she was thinking of me. It helped me to go to sleep...Until you came into my life, Vincent, I'd forgotten how it felt to know that there is someone thinking of me...Someone who knows who I am...Someone that I'm connected to.</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> : Every moment since that night, I'm reminded of what a gift life is.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Ozymandias
<dl><dd> <b>  Vincent: </b> (quoting):I met a traveller from an antique land/ Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone/ Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,/ Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown/ And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command/ Tell that its sculptor well those passions read/ Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,/ The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed./ And on the pedestal these words appear:/ "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:/ Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"/ Nothing beside remains: round the decay/ Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,/ The lone and level sands stretch far away.</dd></dl>

Catherine, the burden you bear with that secret is your aloneness...Know that our bond, our dream, exists at the cost of all your other dreams.

I had a secret place too, a glen. I would lay there in the tall grass and feel like I was the only person on earth. Safe.</dd><dd> <b>  Vincent </b> : Yes</dd><dd> <b>  Catherine </b> : And if I sat very still, the deer would walk by and not ever see me. I could almost reach out and touch them.

Refuse your help? At what point do you draw quietly away from their lives? At what point do you say, "I am no longer responsible." We taught Laura to depend on herself, to think her own thoughts.

Here, I learned to believe again. Hopes and dreams created this fragile world. Pride and vigilence maintain it, and it survives only because it is separate and apart. It is a refuge, where the disillusioned regain their vision, where the lost become found. Where each one of us can explore the best of our being, the best of what it means to be...human and to be alive.</dd></dl>
