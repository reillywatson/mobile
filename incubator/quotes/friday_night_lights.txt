Come on, sit down.</dd><dd> <b>  Coach Taylor </b> : The Boosters and Buddy want me to fire Mac McGill. I don't wanna fire Mac McGill. Mac McGill is a damn good coach and Mac McGill is important for me in the playoffs.

He said they don't have the physicality. But he said they have more creative thinking which makes them more suited to lead. That's what he said. It was a stupid thing to say. I understand.</dd><dd> <b>  Tami </b> : Well, I mean, as the guidance counselor I gotta say that that, to me, is a fireable offense. What he said.</dd><dd> <b>  Coach Taylor </b> : Alright let me talk to my wife.

This is about you. You've been put in this position now where you've got to make the decision. If you don't fire him at this point you are condoning what he said.</dd><dd> <b>  Coach Taylor </b> : Honey he said something stupid, he's not a racist. He's a friend.</dd><dd> <b>  Tami </b> : I know, but that is not something for a kids' assistant coach to say. No less for a government employee, which is what he is.</dd><dd> <b>  Coach Taylor </b> : The three of you scare me.</dd></dl>
