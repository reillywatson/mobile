<dl><dd> <b>  Alan Shore: </b> Mr Lumis, how do you feel about fat people? Because according to the Surgeon General three hundred thousand Americans die every year from obesity-related illnesses.</dd><dd> <b>  Kurt Lumis: </b> Other businesses are firing people for that. I haven't done it yet.</dd><dd> <b>  Alan Shore: </b> So you're thinking about it?</dd><dd> <b>  Kurt Lumis: </b> I'm always thinking.</dd><dd> <b>  Alan Shore: </b> Anyone can see that. How about alcohol consumption? People who have more than fifteen drinks a week are at risk of becoming alcoholics and alcoholism can cause cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, increased incidents of cancer. Wouldn't it be a good idea to monitor your employee's alcohol intake?</dd><dd> <b>  Kurt Lumis: </b> Maybe I should.</dd><dd> <b>  Alan Shore: </b> What about coffee? Caffeine temporarily raises your blood pressure. Trans-fatty acids! And stress! Both of these things could cause heart attacks. That would certainly raise your premiums sky high. It's been proven arguing thirty minutes a day lowers your immune system. As does loneliness, there go your married employees and your single ones! You're going to have to watch these people all the time, Mr Lumis. I hope you're multitasked.</dd><dd> <b>  Kurt Lumis: </b> Mr Shore, I think you're exaggerating.</dd><dd> <b>  Alan Shore: </b> No. I'm just welcoming us all to 1984-the bus arrived a little late, and our tour guide George Orwell is good and dead. But nonetheless, we made it. And big brother Lumis is watching us.</dd></dl>

We put rapists back on the streets knowing they're gonna rape again. Let's not pretend that we don't aid and abet crime. But the key is: Make sure we cover our asses. Defense attorneys do that better than anybody. Now, Alan Shore covered his. He knew he couldn't legally advise Mr. Mkeba to run, and he expressly told him he couldn't give him such advice. Did Mr. Mkeba get the message anyway? Sure, but technically, Alan Shore didn't break the law. Ass covered, over and out. Not guilty, simple as that. Oh, and here's another thing about asses: (Turns to District Attorney Kupfer) Not you, we'll get to you in a second.

And this man, Douglas Kupfer, is aiming for it! He said he wanted to stab him. That's subtle. There's a vendetta. He wants my client, anyway he can get him, and that's the only reason we're here.

Season 3
Whose God Is It Anyway? [3.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Alan: </b> <i>  [closing statement] </i> Ugh, please. It's a dumb freedom. An employee's behavior reflects on their employer, for God's sakes. In this case, we're talking about a business, a law firm, where clients look for good judgment, sound and sane counsel. This guy's running around talking about how humans evolved from a big clam after galactic warlords invaded our volcanoes. He's a nut-job. And I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little tired of this whole "freedom of religion" thing. I mean, when did religion get such a good name anyway? Be it the Crusades, the Reformation Genocides, the troubles in Northern Ireland, Middle East, mass slaughters in the name of Allah, as well as the obligatory reciprocal retribution. Hundreds of millions of people have died in religious conflicts. Hitler did his business in the name of his Creator. 9/11 was an act of religious extremism. It is, in fact, our greatest threat today -- a Holy Jihad. And if we're not ready to strip religion of its sacred cow status, why don't we at least scale back a bit on the constitutional dogma exalting it as all get-out?</dd><dd> <b>  Sally Heep: </b> Your Honor, I'd love to know what this has to with my client being fired.</dd><dd> <b>  Alan: </b> Your client was fired because he entered into an at-will employment contract, he acted like a complete loon, and now he tries to cloak himself in a constitutional amendment that is as overplayed as it is misapplied. Everyone should get to believe in God. Pray to his God, worship his God -- of course. But to impose him on others, to victimize others in his name -- the Founding Fathers of this country set out to prevent persecution, not to license it. And for Jerry Espenson, struggling with his law practice to make ends meet, don't tell me he's not being victimized when one of his lawyers bounces around telling clients and other attorneys that according to his most recent electro-psycho-meter reading, he's getting closer to immortality, at which point he'll be able to leave his body and talk to zebras! At a certain point we have to say, "Enough with this 'freedom of religion' crap!" Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! [goes back to his seat] Yes, I know. I'll get letters.</dd></dl>

Season 3

You're gonna make fun of my flow now?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeffrey: </b> I'm sorry. It just seems a little lackluster. I would think a Marine would be a little more 'Hup To'.

Season 3

Season 3
Lincoln [3.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Alan: </b> Denise, you've always struck me as a woman who secretly longs to be debased. It's an awfully big job.

I see the filthy, naughty girl deep inside you, Denise, longing to get out. Now, if you're so unwilling to let her out, perhaps I should go in after her. I brought my snorkel.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Detective Spindle: </b> What's the infield fly rule?</dd><dd> <b>  Lincoln: </b> I haven't the slightest.

Season 3
Lincoln [3.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Alan: </b> Denise, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Shirley. I happen to know sometimes grief can trigger the libido. It's got something to do with death causing a biological need to propagate the species. Evidently after 9-11, people were running around like rabbits.</dd><dd> <b>  Denise: </b> Really? I did not know that.</dd><dd> <b>  Alan: </b> If I could ever be of service...to help you cope.</dd></dl>
