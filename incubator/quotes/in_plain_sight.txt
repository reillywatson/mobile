Pilot[1.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : As I was saying, imagery and metaphor have been used to sell projects forever.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Please, Jesus, take me now.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Take the Ford Mustang, for instance. It's named for a powerful and agile animal, qualities we also seek in an automobile. It's called transference.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Okay, what about my Probe? Exactly what image is that supposed to transfer? Because all I'm getting is a paper dress, metal stirrups, and legs akimbo. Exactly what was the thought process behind that marketing coup? Say, Bob, what's a metaphor for an invasive, somewhat humiliating procedure, because we really need something to compete with the Chevy Speculum.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Are you going to be like this all day?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Like what?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : <i>  [Makes cat fighting noise] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Guess it depends on how long it's going to be my birthday.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : All day.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : There you go.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Pilot[1.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> The Federal Witness Protection Program is the most secretive organization in all of law enforcement. We do not talk about what we do. Not to friends, not to family, not even to other U.S. Marshals. Which is why my mother, my sister, and even my boyfriend, who by the way isn't really my boyfriend, all think I'm a glorified messenger with a gun. And why Marshall and I work on the roof of the Sunshine Building, while the rest of the U.S. Marshals reside in the Pete Domenici Federal Courthouse , with their mahogany desks, crystal chandeliers and butlers.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Pilot[1.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I just want to wash the stench of this day off and go to bed.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I know, but there are about sixty people in there hiding behind furniture, just waiting for you to open the door so they can jump up and say surprise.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Yuck.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Come on, it's your birthday. This isn't about you. Now get ready to act surprised.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : All right, all right.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : That's my girl.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Hoosier Daddy[1.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : How many times a week do people tell you you suck?</dd><dd> <b>  Arlo Meyers </b> : Are you going to let her speak to me like this?</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : It seems like a valid question.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Hoosier Daddy[1.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [After walking in the front door of McRoy's home] </i> Chrome and glass. Kind of cliche for a drug dealer, no?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Hoosier Daddy[1.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I might have a problem.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : You think this is new information?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I don't think I can turn him over.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Okay, but you're going to have to feed him and take him for walks.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I'm serious, Marshall.

Hoosier Daddy[1.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Listen to me. Forget about everything else and just tell the truth.

Everything's going to be okay. Do you trust me?</dd><dd> <b>  Leo Billups </b> : Like I have a choice. <i>  [Walks into the judge's chambers] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I finally meet a guy that gets me and he's ten.</dd></dl>

Never The Bride[1.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : God, I hate con-artists. Even more than murderers.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Never The Bride[1.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Now then, I want you to understand something. This program is an opportunity very few people get. A shot at fresh start; a do-over of your entire life, but it only works if you make the decision to be a better human being than you've been and allow the possibility of something greater for yourself. And as impossible as it may seem, I've seen bigger scumbags than you do just that and make it stick.</dd></dl>
Season 1

Never The Bride[1.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : What are you doing?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : What? Nothing. I'm doing my job, keeping my eye on things.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Look at me.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : No. Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Because I'm talking to you. Oh my God. You can't look at me. Marshall, for God's sake. It's not like I'm naked.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Naked would be better. That makes me feel so dirty.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Good Lord. Watch the door, Purvis.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Marshall. Marshall! Can you hear me?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I must have bumped my head.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Yeah, that's what happened.

Season 1
Trojan Horst[1.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : What do you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I think if that really was Lola, she knows this is her only shot at Mr. Personality before he talks to the feds.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Which means she's coming back.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Dun, dun, duh.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : That's pretty funny for a guy with a sucking chest wound.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I know.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Trojan Horst[1.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : How are we doing?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Tension pneumothorax.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : That's funny.

Season 1
Who Shot Jay Arnstein[1.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> Funny how things like mortgage payments and a desire to not eat cat food can get between a person and their principles. Damn, I hate principles.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Who Shot Jay Arnstein[1.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> If there's one thing working in witness protection has taught me it's that people hate change. Oh, we all say we want to change; get thinner, quit smoking, learn to speak Portuguese, but we don't. For better or worse, our habits define us. We turn the pages of the same tattered script over and over, clinging to our well rehearsed routines like barnacles, and nothing rankles us more than having to learn new lines.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Who Shot Jay Arnstein[1.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : What exactly is your beef with humanity?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I have no beef with humanity. It's people I can't stand.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Who Shot Jay Arnstein[1.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [On the phone] </i> Hey, Stan, it's Mary. Imagine my surprise when Kay Swenson showed up drunk at Jay Arnstein's gallery and got into a fistfight with Marci Arnstein. Who could have possibly predicted that deceiving a witness and helping her husband commit adultery with his tramp mistress would end badly? You'd have to be a genius to see that one coming, right? Anyway, Stan, I'll need immediate relocation authorization. Call me! Bye!</dd></dl>
Season 1
Who Shot Jay Arnstein[1.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Detective Dershowitz </b> : Okay, what is taking you so long? Can't you go any faster?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I could, but then I'd miss the fun of watching you lapse into hysteria.</dd></dl>

High Priced Spread[1.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Man, every time I walk into a gym it gets my blood up.</dd><dd> <b>  Scott Worley </b> : Oh, did you play?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Badminton. We played our tournaments here. See this scar? Shuttlecock injury. Ended my career.</dd><dd> <b>  Scott Worley </b> : Is he kidding?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I don't know. Either way, it's pathetic.</dd><dd> <b>  Scott Worley </b> : Excuse me. <i>  [Leaves] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Way to work shuttlecock into the conversation, jackass.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : It's one of the funnier words.</dd></dl>
Season 1
High Priced Spread[1.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Hey there, Socrates. What brings you to these hallowed halls? <i>  Boning </i> up on your philosophy? Taking an <i>  oral </i> exam? Having sex with your old professor?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Okay, get it out of your system.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Look at you. All blushy.</dd></dl>
Season 1
High Priced Spread[1.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jinx </b> : <i>  [Holding an old photograph of Mary and her father] </i> Look at this one. I think you were four, maybe five here.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I don't remember this.</dd><dd> <b>  Jinx </b> : You father hit corner at Belmont, went shopping at Berghoff's. Eight dollars for a little girl's dress. I almost killed him. The way he fawned. Isn't that crazy? A mother being jealous of her four-year-old daughter.</dd></dl>
Season 1
High Priced Spread[1.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : One way or another, I am going to nail that guy. I mean literally, nail him, fillet his hide to a tree, spread it with jam and watch the squirrels go to town.</dd></dl>
Season 1
High Priced Spread[1.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : He called me ma'am.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Yeah, but he was looking down your shirt when he said it.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Why are you being so nice to me?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Iris Doesn't Live Here Anymore[1.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> I think my least favorite phrase in the human language is "I'm sorry." Nine times out of ten when a person says they're sorry, they're really only sorry they got caught, and now want me to forgive them for something I'm still pissed off about. Which puts me in the unhappy position of either saying, "Up yours" and looking like a total bitch, or saying, "I forgive you" and feeling like a total schmuck.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Don of the Dead[1.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Please explain, in God's name, why you two don't get a divorce. You make each other miserable. Please don't say it's because you're catholic. Lots of catholics get divorced these days. Hell, I'm catholic, I plan on getting divorced one day.</dd><dd> <b>  Donald Ferguson </b> : It'll be a lucky man who divorces you.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Damn straight.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Don of the Dead[1.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : He was one of the few truly good, selfless people I've ever met.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : You know, Ayn Rand's central thesis posits that selflessness is antithetical to good.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : A hundred bucks says you die a lonely old man.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Don of the Dead[1.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Donald Ferguson </b> : Shhhhh.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : What?! I just spent two days running all over creation thinking you were kidnapped or dead! Half the hobos in Albuquerque are in mourning and Cook's facing murder charges, and you have the balls to shush me?</dd></dl>
Season 1
Good Cop, Dead Cop[1.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : You can stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking.</dd><dd> <b>  Robert Eps </b> : Oh, come on, man. You mean to tell me you have a partner that looks like that and you still get pissy when guys check her out? Maybe you're the one who needs to stop thinking what you're thinking.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Good Cop, Dead Cop[1.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Why don't you go on home?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Nope.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I don't get it. So what if your mom showed up unannounced. She just wanted to surprise you.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : There are two kinds of surprises, Marshall: birthday and Pearl Harbor. Guess which category the "mom surprise" falls under? It doesn't matter. I hate them both.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Well you can't stay here forever.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : No, but I think I can do a week. I bet if I don't show up for a week she'll run out of food and booze and leave.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Good Cop, Dead Cop[1.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Wow. It looks like somebody kicked the crap out of you.</dd><dd> <b>  Det. Roxanne Lewis </b> : You hit like a girl.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Thanks, you too.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Good Cop, Dead Cop[1.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Det. Dershowitz </b> : Let's not start accusing people until we have the proper evidence.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Wow. Talk about the cop calling the kettle black. That's funny. That never sounded racist until now. My bad.</dd></dl>
Season 1
To Serge with Love[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : He thinks he's got a shot with me.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : <i>  [Speaking to their witness] </i> You have no shot. In fact, Joe Stalin's rotting corpse has a better chance of getting into her <i>  bryuki </i> than you do.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Aw. You can be so sweet sometimes.</dd></dl>
Season 1
To Serge with Love[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Tasha's so excited for me to meet her new boyfriend. It's really sweet. Oh, God. I hope we didn't miss him. I don't know why I'm always late with her.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Habitual lateness most often manifests in people with control issues.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Oh, God.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : By arriving late on scheduled appointments you cause the person with whom the appointment was made to wait, for you, thereby controlling his or her behavior. Classic passive aggressive pathology.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : When have you ever known me to be passive about anything?</dd></dl>
Season 1
To Serge with Love[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [To Marshall] </i> I love you like an eight dollar whore.</dd></dl>
Season 1
To Serge with Love[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : SwifferMuseum.com. Why? How? Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : What about KnittingWholesale.com? Maybe he's trying to lure old women into the lurid world of cross-stitching.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : CowsAreEvil.com.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Undeniable.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : OverstockedPradaLeather.com.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : What? What was that last one?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Kidding.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Bastard.</dd></dl>
Season 1
To Serge with Love[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [Voicover] </i> I stare agape at Sunday couples. Sidewalk strollers, fingers laced, heads on shoulders, hearts laid bare. Audacious highwire artists, soaring netless. Oblivious or brave? Ignorant idiots, I observe from my spectator view. Hoping no one hears this screaming inside my head.</dd></dl>
Season 1
A Fine Meth[1.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jinx </b> : That first week after he left, you were so distraught. You thought it was your fault. That you had done something to make him go away. I just wanted to make you feel better. I made up this story about how you were daddy's favorite. How he loved you the most, and you had this special bond that couldn't be broken no matter how far away he was. The truth is, he loved you like he loved the rest of us. No more, no less. I'm sorry we were lying to you then, and I'm sorry about having to tell you the truth now. But I thought you would eventually realize what a fairytale this all was.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Oh, mom. That must have been so hard for you. Wait. I want to share something with you. Stay there. <i>  [Leaves the room] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jinx </b> : <i>  [To Brandi] </i> I needed to do that. It was necessary.</dd><dd> <b>  Brandi </b> : I think it's good that she heard it.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Sorry, you don't get to rewrite history. <i>  [Puts wooden box on the table] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Brandi </b> : What's that?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Open it.</dd><dd> <b>  Jinx </b> : What are these?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Letters I've received from daddy over the last twenty years or so. How many has he sent you guys?</dd></dl>
Season 2
Gilted Lilly[2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : What's going on, Stan?</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : Her name is Eleanor Prince. She was the administrator to the FBI HQ in Phoenix for eight years. Her husband was a field agent and got killed last year in an auto accident.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : You realize Mary is going to have a problem with this.</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : It crossed my mind. You have to get her to accept Eleanor.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Shall I teach her to levitate while I'm at it? Come on. You know Mary doesn't like new people.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Gilted Lilly[2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Det. Dershowitz </b> : So do you like any of them for this?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : It's hard to find a motive for murder. I suppose any of them could have assisted.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : When I kill my mother there will be no doubt as to who did it.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Gilted Lilly[2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Eleanor </b> : Can I get you anything, chief?</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : Um, no. No, thank you.</dd><dd> <b>  Eleanor </b> : Sir, you didn't do anything wrong. They were both out of line.</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : Mrs. Prince. When I came into this office ten years ago I had twice as many inspectors handling half as many witnesses and it was still too many, which is why I'm so grateful you're here. I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but when I want an opinion on matters of my inspectors, I'll ask. Okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Eleanor </b> : Are you sure I can't get you anything?</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : Yeah, a cup of coffee would be great.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Gilted Lilly[2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Second bottle, mom?</dd><dd> <b>  Jinx </b> : For those keeping score.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Second bottle is the ironic Jinx. You want to be gone by number three.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Say no more, and you go to bed.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I'm fine.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I know, and you need to remember that. Whatever's happening inside your head needs to happen. Now just let it flow. Be the river.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Don't be a retard. I can't be the river.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : You can be the river!</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Okay, but not today. Tomorrow I'll be the river.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : That a girl.</dd></dl>

Season 2
In My Humboldt Opinion[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Man, oh, man, O'Connor. You FBI guys. I've been on the job for five years. I don't even have a cubicle. You've been in town, what, six minutes? You have a private office? Now how is that fair? By the way, I was just wondering when you think I can expect a crew at my house to fix your mess.</dd><dd> <b>  Agent O'Connor </b> : You know, I was just going to call you about that. I'm looking into the first of week of when hell freezes over. Does that work for you? Because if not I can reschedule.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : No, that's about what I expected. Yeah, so in the meantime I'll just store some of my stuff here. <i>  [Dumps a box full of sheetrock and insulation on O'Connor's desk] </i> Does that work for you?</dd></dl>
Season 2
In My Humboldt Opinion[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Okay, you know what, Eleanor? I've tried to be nice. Cut you some slack because you're new, but this is it. I've had it.</dd><dd> <b>  Eleanor </b> : I'm sorry, when was it that you tried to to be nice? I must have missed that.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Yeah, probably because nothing can penetrate that helmet of hairspray and noxious cloud of perfume surrounding you.</dd><dd> <b>  Eleanor </b> : Excuse me.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : What?!</dd><dd> <b>  Eleanor </b> : Inspector, certain other persons around here might be afraid of you, walk on egg shells. God forbid anyone should upset her highness, but I'm not one of them. You are a bully and you're spoiled and for some reason you have been given a pass on rude behavior, but I won't put up with it. It's unacceptable.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : You think I give a rat's ass what you will or won't put up with, Eleanor?</dd></dl>
Season 2
In My Humboldt Opinion[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Amnesia, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Don't you dare laugh.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I would never. Although, it is surprising this hasn't happened before, considering how many people would like to forget they ever met you.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Took you a long time to think of that one, didn't it?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Almost an hour.</dd></dl>

What, were you raised by guinea pigs? <i>  [slips and falls down the rubble] </i> Okay, okay, I might have just soiled myself.</dd><dd> <b>  Lewis Ford </b> : <i>  [wincing in pain] </i> Don't make me laugh!</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : So this is your new place? <i>  [slowly makes her way towards Lewis, who's buried in rubble] </i> It's very industrial retro.</dd><dd> <b>  Lewis Ford </b> : Where's my housewarming gift?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I never did get why when someone buys a new house you're supposed to buy them a present. I mean, why not just put a tip jar by the door?</dd><dd> <b>  Lewis Ford </b> : Thanks for coming, but you need to get outta here, the whole building's gonna come down.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Quit being such a drama queen Lewis, we'll both be outta here in no time.

Okay Doc, walk me through this.</dd><dd> <b>  Doctor </b> : Before you do anything, you need to put on a pair of surgical gloves.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : No glove, no love.</dd><dd> <b>  Doctor </b> : You're not allergic to latex, are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : If I had a nickle for every time I've been asked that question...</dd><dd> <b>  Lewis Ford </b> : If I wasn't dying, you'd be funny.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : You're not dying.

No matter what, because that's what partners do. You said it yourself: At the end of the day, all that matters you and your partner. You turned on your partner. The second things got ugly, Lewis. The one constant that gets me through it all, the only reason that makes it okay for me to be up here with a worm like you, is I have a partner who has my back, 24/7, no matter what. <i>  ... </i> Oh, and Marshall, for the record, I'd sell you out for a Twinkie .</dd></dl>

Rubble With A Cause[2.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> I yearn for blind devotion; unthinking, unwavering. A cause, a thing, a principle worthy of absolute loyalty.

To the true believers, the lucky few, of thee I sing.</dd></dl>

Your wife and your unborn child lie on the operating table, maybe dying, and you ask God how he can do this to you? You schmuck. God gave you life. God gave you a brain in your head. That's it. The beginning, the middle, the end of all God did to you. All the rest, Avi, the lying, the cheating, stealing, that's all on you, you self-involved child. What are you going to do? Spend the rest of your life trying to find someone else to blame? Or do you think that maybe it's time that you use that brain in your head that God gave you?</dd></dl>

Season 2
One Night Stan[2.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [Voiceover] </i> I once dated a man who taught quantum physics. I learned two things that night. The first being, if you ask a quantum physicist to explain how gravity works--not what it is, not how it behaves, but how it works--he will first talk himself in circles, then wind up crying, and finally, sometime between entree and dessert, call you a bitch and leave.</dd><dd> ...</dd><dd> The second revelation came as I sat at the bar in morose solitude, pondering the cantilevered relationship between bartenders' gut and lower extremities, and this is important, so pay attention: before the big bang, before time itself, before matter, energy, velocity, there existed a single immeasurable state called yearning. This is the special force that on the day before days obliterated nothing into everything. It is the unseen strings tying planets to stars. It is the maddening want we feel from from first breath to last light.</dd></dl>
Season 2
One Night Stan[2.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : So, Brandi finally dates someone respectable, and she wants to dump him?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Respectable and rich.

Season 2
Duplicate Bridge[2.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : We build our house on these manifold truths: rough hewn and perfect, like the ashlars of Solomon's temple. He is to be condemned, but also deeply pitied. Wrong and injustice once done cannot be undone, but are eternal in their consequences. Without verity, there is no justice.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Duplicate Bridge[2.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Everyone has failures in life. Ultimately all of us fail. The aqueducts of Rome will fail! Who we are, the standards by which we are measured lies in our response to those failures. My dad used to tell me you don't fail until you quit.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Duplicate Bridge[2.07]

<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall Mann </b> : How does a civilian get clearance to shoot a video for a top secret government agency?</dd><dd> <b>  Barry Ness </b> : The same as any other independent contractor: a long and tedious vetting process.

Season 2
Let's Get it Ahn[2.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Eleanor </b> : <i>  [rescuing Marshall's finger] </i> The hardest part is the knuckle. It's sort of like the baby's shoulders in the birthing process.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Ugh. You have any idea what that makes my ring!</dd></dl>

You've keenly observed that I'm somewhat relationship phobic, and yet the conclusion you've drawn couldn't be more off the mark. Marshall, I've spent my entire working live with career criminals: liars, thieves and sociopaths, each of whom knows what I do for a living.

You need to get to the point.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : The point is: everybody here knows you're too smart to shoot a cop for no good reason, and that nothing happens on that street without your knowing about it.</dd><dd> <b>  Gang Leader </b> : What's that gotta do with dreams?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Well, this kind of thing is gonna be really bad for your business, and if there were some other place you dreamed of... or something you always wanted to be...</dd><dd> <b>  Gang Leader </b> : What? You're gonna wave your magic wand and tomorrow I'm on a beach in Hawaii?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : No, but I have friends who make that sort of thing happen all the time. All we need from you is the right information. Would you like to be in Hawaii tomorrow? With a new name? Whole new life. I can have a US Attorney in here in five minutes making that happen. Just tell me who the shooter is, and how to find him.</dd><dd> <b>  Gang Leader </b> : <i>  Sa es que, cabron </i> ? We're born where we're born. We is what we is, and that's that. I ain't going nowhere, and I ain't telling you <i>  nothing </i> .</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Doctor </b> : How are you feeling?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Good. Better. Because if I say anything else I'm not getting out of here, so great!</dd><dd> <b>  Doctor </b> : How's your memory?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Fantastic! I was shot by a smudge.</dd><dd> <b>  Doctor </b> : I told you it might come back slowly or in pieces. Or --</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Not at all, which means no matter what happens you get to be right. You're not letting me out, are you? I'm going to be here another week, I knew it!</dd><dd> <b>  Doctor </b> : Promise me you'll take it slow.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Wait. Is that condescending doctor talk for I can go?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [Mary looks at and strokes her new granite countertop] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Rafael </b> : Do you like it?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Are you kidding? I want to get drunk and do it.</dd></dl>

Season 3
When Mary Met Marshall[3.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> There's a researcher who claims he can tell if a couple is going to break up based on how they talk to each other. An ability I've had since I was five, without NIH funding. I just looked up at my parents and thought "nope."</dd></dl>
Season 3
When Mary Met Marshall[3.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Wow, Stan. Opening day at Ascot?</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : I have a meeting with Allison Pearson.</dd><dd> <i>  [Mary shakes her head in confusion] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : The newly appointment U.S. Marshall for our district.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Right! Right, the political hack who licked D.C. butt like a creamsicle so she could tell actual marshals how to do a job she can't comprehend, let alone be in charge of. <i>  That </i> Allison Pearson.</dd><dd> <i>  [Marshall nods in confirmation] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : You two are going to be gone all day, right?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : No, but it's okay. I think your meeting with Allison is tomorrow.</dd><dd> <b>  Stan </b> : Is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Oops. That's good! It gives you time to buy the top hat and monocle.</dd></dl>
Season 3
When Mary Met Marshall[3.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : This is so stupid!</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Okay, let's take a moment here and think this through. Henry set it all up, had Lebowski there break in, steal everything and the box of photos to intentionally create a security breach so that we would what, be forced to move them. Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I have no idea. Here's what I do know: I don't care! I'm sick of it! I'm sick of needy, crazy, stupid liars. Seriously, I can't take it anymore! I grew up with them, I live with them, I work with them, and no matter how fast I run or far I go, they breed and come after me! It's like a zombie movie, except the only scary part is that it never ends!</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : How'd that feel?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Really good!</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Anything else?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I think I hit it all.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Ready?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Ready.

Season 3
When Mary Met Marshall[3.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I like driving at night.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Me too.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I remember being with my dad when I was six, seven. He'd bundle us all up at bedtime and take off for someplace. My brothers and I in the back, half asleep, mom and dad up front. Nobody talking. Just the sound of the road in the dark. Aren't you going to say something funny and mean that'll blow holes in me?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : It sounds nice. My dad had this sweet tooth. Kicked in sometimes late at night. My mom would be getting sloshed, gearing up for a fight, and we'd slip out. Go to this all night place for ice cream. Mostly to get away from her. That and I think he liked being with me. Just the two of us, driving around in the dark singing to the radio.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I'll bet he did. I cannot imagine you were a dull child.</dd></dl>
Season 3
When Mary Met Marshall[3.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> I pride myself on being able to tell when a relationship won't work, and normally I love being right more than anything. More than Blue Moon beer, Exxon on Main Street, food smothered in malaise sauce, but sometimes it's good to be wrong.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Coma Chameleon[3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> My dad once said time kills everything; hope, health, dreams, even love. He told me this on my birthday. I'd just turned six. Then he gave me my present, a pet rock, which I later used in an incident I'd regret. I'm not sure I got it at the time, but I get it now: everything we love is eventually murdered by the hands of time.</dd></dl>

Coma Chameleon[3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Everything okay with you?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Besides a witness who --</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I mean is everything okay with you.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [looks at him for a while] </i> Everything with Rafe is really good, so --</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : So?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I should be happy about that.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : And what are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Scared. Pissed. Guilty. And happy. Happy's in there.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Somewhere?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Happy's under a bit of a pile.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : How come?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I think I want something that just doesn't exist. I want something that's just right. No argument or doubt, which is insane, right? Because there's always argument, there's always doubt. So, I guess what I'm after here is the insane goal of an insane person.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I would say it's the ideal goal of someone who has somehow managed to protect the purest part of her heart, which does not seem insane to anyone who really knows you.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Which would be you and you.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Coma Chameleon[3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Wade Trimble </b> : Without Krista there's no point in anything.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I know it seems impossible now, but you might meet someone else. Someone you love just as much, maybe more!</dd><dd> <b>  Wade </b> : You're never really been in love. If you had, you'd understand.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I have. I am!</dd><dd> <b>  Wade </b> : Did it happen with one look? Because everything you need is in that first second of that first look.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Coma Chameleon[3.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Some say love is the only thing we have that is real. Some say life would be a whole lot better without it. For me, the jury's still out. I loved that pet rock my dad gave me because it was from him. Then I threw it at Robert Kwame. Hit him right in the temple. He went down like a Christmas tree in January. I loved Robert, I just wanted to make sure he knew it. I think he did. He ended up being my first kiss.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Rafael </b> : I think we need to have a talk.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Okay.</dd><dd> <b>  Rafael </b> : I don't think we should get married in July. Or at all.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [sighs] </i> I knew it when Rita hugged me.</dd><dd> <b>  Rafael </b> : You've said it before. I didn't listen. You and I, we don't work.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : It's been hard from the start. <i>  [Rafe nods in agreement] </i> I don't know why it isn't easier.</dd><dd> <b>  Rafael </b> : Life isn't short. It's long and honestly, I don't know if you love me enough to make this work.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I do love you.</dd><dd> <b>  Rafael </b> : But enough? Maybe that's why it's been so difficult. If I'm wrong you'll say something before I get out of here, okay?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Okay.</dd><dd> <i>  [Rafael leaves without Mary stopping him] </i></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : What is that?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : My first work of origami. Notes?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Stop now or you will never get laid again.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Whistle Stop[3.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Help: the absolute worst of the four letter words and the one I know best. A six year old on tip-toes peering into Brandi's crib, my mother on the bedroom floor, scrounging for the booze, that word coming out of their mouths as a gasp. Like destiny. Help. I've learned over time help doesn't mean grab the other paint roller or hold the ladder still. It means, hey, I screwed up, now what are we gonna do? Help, more than anything, is the not so subtle herald of the appearance of we. Don't even get me started on happy to help.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Whistle Stop[3.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : No silence. I can't take silence right now.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Okay. Why aren't you wearing your engagement ring?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Raph and I broke up. <i>  [long pause] </i> I said no silence.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Right. So.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Oh, my God, Marshall. You're killing me.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I really don't know what to say.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Now? Now you don't know what to say? Seven years I get a combo geyser of Wikipedia, Jeopardy, Star Trek, Dead Poet's Society, Carnac the Magnificent and now, the one time I need a steady stream of useless numbing babble I get car sounds!</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : When did you two break up?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : No, no, no! No questions! Anyone can do questions. I want pointless quotes! Useless trivia! The downpour of idiocy you practically patented! Come on! It's a twenty minute car trip. I don't want to think about my life, okay? Amaze me, annoy me, distract me. Is that so much to ask?</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : This is so weird. I got nothing.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Oh, my God. You're verbally impotent.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I swear, this has never happened before.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Whistle Stop[3.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : I guess I'll have to return the ice cream maker I got for your engagement gift. French style, highly aerated ice cream in twenty five minutes. You know, the history of ice cream is as fascinating as it is long. Let us begin at the beginning. In ancient Greece --</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Marshall. I'm good.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Sorry I choked before.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : It happens.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Not to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : I'm sure you'll be great next time.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Maybe we can just talk?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [laughs] </i> Sure.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : So, why did you and Raph break up?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Because he's a beautiful, sweet, sensitive man who adored me.</dd><dd> <b>  Marshall </b> : Yeah, who wants that?</dd><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : Exactly.</dd></dl>
Season 3
Whistle Stop[3.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Mary </b> : <i>  [voiceover, as Marshall fields a call from Faber for her without her knowing] </i> Help, every now and then, is something more than a four letter word. Sometimes it's just a baby crying for her sister from the confines of a crib. And sometimes, if you're lucky, help comes without asking, because somewhere nearby is someone who'd rather keep you from falling than help you up after you do.</dd></dl>
