So tell me John, how do you plan on piloting our submarine. Its a complicated piece of machinery. You just don't press submerge.</dd><dd> <b>  Locke </b> : I'll figure something out. For all you know I was a commander in the Navy. Put your arm around my neck and I'll lift under your knees.</dd><dd> <b>  Ben </b> : What's in the pack, John? If you met Mikail that means you were at the communications station, which means you found the explosives. So you're not planning on piloting the submarine anywhere, you're planning to destroy it. I know you, John Locke.</dd><dd> <b>  Locke </b> : You don't know me at all.</dd><dd> <b>  Ben </b> : I know you were born in California. I know that you were raised in foster care.

Most of them were recruited and brought here, and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know that they can leave if they want to. The sub maintains that illusion.</dd><dd> <b>  Locke </b> : So you're lying to them?</dd><dd> <b>  Ben </b> : No... they're here because they want to be here. Some of them are just not ready to make a full commitment yet. But you John, you've already made that commitment. And now you have a choice, because if you stop and think, I can show you things. things I know that you want to see very badly. Let me put it so you'll understand: picture a box. You know something about boxes, don't you John? What if I told you that somewhere on this island there is a very large box and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you open that box, there it would be. What would you say about that John?</dd><dd> <b>  Locke </b> : I'd say that I hope that box is big enough for you to imagine up a new submarine.</dd><dd> <b>  Ben </b> : Why are you so angry John?</dd><dd> <b>  Locke </b> : Because you're cheating. You communicate with the outside world whenever you want to, you come and go as you please, you use electricity and running water and guns. You're a hypocrite. You don't deserve to be on this island. If you had any idea what this place was you wouldn't be putting chicken in your refrigerator.</dd><dd> <b>  Ben </b> : You have been on this island for 80 days, John. I have been here my entire life. So what makes you think you know this island better than I do?</dd><dd> <b>  Locke </b> : Because you're in the wheelchair, and I'm not.</dd></dl>

Then again, you tried to steal their diamonds, but we wanted to look to you. Look around. You made everyone happy. Just for today, they can eat boar, laugh, and forget that they're totally screwed.

But hiding's pointless; they're just going to keep coming back, so I went out and I found some help. And for the past few days, she's been bringing dynamite back from the <i>  Black Rock </i> . For the very first time, we know exactly what they want, when they're coming to get it and they have no idea. We're going to be waiting for them. So Juliet's going to mark the tents with the white rocks just like she was told to, but there's not going to be any pregnant women inside; there's going to be plenty of what we just used on that tree. So tomorrow night, we stop hiding, we stop running, we stop living in fear of them, because when they show up, we're going to blow them all to hell.</dd></dl>

As you've no doubt surmised, station six or, "The Orchid", is not a botanical research unit. The unique properties of this island have created a kind of casimir effect allowing the Dharma Initiative to conduct unique experiments in both space and time. This is "The Vault". Constructed adjacent to a pocket of what we believe to be negatively charged "exotic matter". Great care must be taken to avoid leaving inorganic materials inside the chamber. The electromagnetic energy within the island can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Now for your own safety and the safety of those around you, metallic objects must never be placed within the vault. <i>  [Locke looks at Ben putting as many metallic objects in the vault as he can find] </i> In our first demonstration, we will attempt to shift the test subject 100 milliseconds ahead in four-dimensional space.

<dl><dd> <b>  Keamy </b> : I know you're down here, Ben. Crouching in the dark, just waiting to take a shot at me. Well, you better aim for the head, Ben! You know, like your boyfriend who shot me in the back, like a coward! This body armor's, um, been known to take a bullet or two in it's time. But before you take your shot, Ben, let me tell you about this. <i>  [Raises his arm to show a device strapped to his arm, with a green light] </i> See that? I took out a bit of a life insurance policy, Ben. It's a heart rate monitor, and it's connected to a radio transmitter, we call it a "Dead Man's Trigger", Ben. If my heart stops beating, it sends a little signal to the 500 pounds of C4 that I've got hardwired out there on the freighter. That'd kill a lot of innocent people, Ben. If you think I'm bluffing, need I remind you of, uh, how your daughter looked as she bled out? Face down on the grass?</dd></dl>

And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island. We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up. And by then, there were six of us. That part was true. But the rest of the people... who were on the plane? They're still on that island.</dd></dl>

Because he pursued that belief until it got him killed. And because you were kind enough to bring his body back here in a nice little wooden box.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : And he had to be dead before you could look like him?</dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> : That's right.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : And who else have you looked like?</dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> :...What do you really want to ask me, Jack?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Our third day here, I chased my father in the jungle, my dead father. Was that you?</dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> : Yes, that was me.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> : Because you needed to find water. Jack, I know this must be hard for you to understand, but all I've ever tried to do is help you.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : You wanna help me?</dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> : Yes, but you were trapped here, before you even came to the Island. Because of Jacob. And now that he's dead, we don't need to be here. We can get on a plane and leave anytime we want.</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : If you could just get on a plane, why would you even still be here?</dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> : Because we have to do it together.</dd><dd> <i>  [Jack still looks uncertain] </i></dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Jack </b> : John Locke was the only one of us who ever believed in this Island, he always said that--</dd><dd> <b>  The Man in Black </b> : John Locke was not a believer, Jack. He was a sucker.</dd></dl>
