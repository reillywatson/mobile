Thanks to your ministrations I'm almost completely healed but the damage I did to them will last a lifetime.</dd></dl>

It's so bubbly and cloying and happy.</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : Just like the Federation.</dd><dd> <b>  Quark </b> : And you know what's really frightening? If you drink enough of it, you begin to like it.</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : It's insidious.</dd><dd> <b>  Quark </b> : Just like the Federation.</dd><dd> <i>  [pause] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : Do you think they can save us?</dd><dd> <b>  Quark </b> : I hope so.</dd></dl>

Hippocratic Oath[4.4]
<dl><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : Keiko only spends a few days at a time on the station. I'm the one living in those quarters, and if I want to set up a little workshop in the bedroom...</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : You set up a workshop in the bedroom?</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : Yeah. I don't use it when she's visiting.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : No, of course not.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : She says I'm trying to live like a bachelor again, that I'm expressing a subconscious desire to push her out of our quarters.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : Now that <i>  is </i> ridiculous.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : That's what I said!</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : I mean, if anything, by spending your free time in the bedroom, a place you intimately associate with Keiko, you are actually expressing...a desire to be closer to her...during her absence. It's quite touching, really.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : Exactly! Exactly! See, you understand. Why can't she see that? Why can't she be more like...</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : ...more like...?</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : <i>  [Beat] </i> ...uh, a man. Y-you know, more like a man.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : So...you wish that Keiko...was a man.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : I wish I was on this trip with someone else, that's what I wish.</dd></dl>

Indiscretion[4.5]
<dl><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : Tell me something... Who's Tora Ziyal? When I reactivated the Ravinok's computer, I downloaded the manifest. There were two civilians on board, in addition to the prisoners and the crew. Your... friend Tora Naprem and a Tora Ziyal, a thirteen year-old girl.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : I suppose you wouldn't believe me if I told you she was Naprem's sister?</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : Ziyal is a Cardassian name.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Rejoined[4.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : Quite an audience.</dd><dd> <b>  Lenara Kahn </b> : Seems a shame to disappoint them. We should probably do something.</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : We could get into a screaming match. Start throwing things at each other?</dd><dd> <b>  Lenara Kahn </b> : Not bad. Or I suppose we could throw ourselves at each other...profess our undying love and complete disregard for Trill society?</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : Doctor Pren would probably have a heart attack!</dd></dl>
Season 4
Rejoined[4.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : What do Klingons dream about?</dd><dd> <b>  Worf </b> : Things that will send cold chills down your spine and wake you in the middle of the night. No, it is better that you do not know. Excuse me. <i>  [He leaves] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : I can never tell when he's joking.</dd><dd> <b>  Lenara Kahn </b> : Perhaps it is better that we 'do not know'.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Rejoined[4.6]
<dl><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : Everyone's trying to... look out for us. Protect us from ourselves. But in the end, all that matters is how we feel... and what we do about it. Because either way, we're the ones who have to live with the consequences.</dd><dd> <b>  Lenara Kahn </b> : That's the tricky part though, isn't it? Living with the consequences. When I'm not with you, when you're not around, it's like part of me is missing. I want to be with you more than anything...But I don't think I can do this.</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : Can you really walk away from me... from us? After all this time we're back together. Don't throw that away.</dd><dd> <b>  Lenara Kahn </b> : I don't want to...Maybe I need more time...maybe if I go back to Trill for a while...think it over...I could always come back later...</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : I wish I could believe that. But ultimately, it comes down to this... if you feel about me the way I feel about you... you won't get on that transport tomorrow. And if you do leave... I think we both know you're never coming back.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Nog </b> : I'm sorry captain, the names of Red Squad members are supposed to be secret.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : But you know who they are?</dd><dd> <b>  Nog </b> : He-he. It's not easy keeping secrets from a Ferengi, and I feel funny telling anyone else. Besides if they found out I told you, I'd never get in.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : Cadet, you are obviously under the mistaken impression that I am asking a favor. <i>  [increasingly hostile voice] </i> I want a name and I want it now and that is an order. Understood Mr. Nog?</dd><dd> <b>  Nog </b> : Yes sir.</dd></dl>

We have Lieutenant Arriaga in custody on the Defiant and he is ready to admit that under your orders, he attached a subspace modulator to the relay satellite on the far side of the wormhole. That's why it was opening and closing at random.</dd><dd> <b>  Admiral Leyton </b> : Why would anyone want to do that?</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : To make it look like a cloaked Dominion fleet was coming through the wormhole. That way when Earth's power relays were sabatoged, people would think that an invasion was imminent.</dd><dd> <b>  Admiral Leyton </b> : That's a very interesting theory, but it's not going to do you much good. Lieutenant Arriaga... isn't going to get to Earth. I've sent the Lakota to intercept the Defiant.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : You really think one Starfleet starship will fire on another?</dd><dd> <b>  Admiral Leyton </b> : As far as Benteen's crew is concerned, the Defiant isn't a Starfleet ship. They've been told that everyone on the Defiant's been replaced by shapeshifters.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : I don't know why Captain Sisko insists on me being here. I'm not a senior officer.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : Maybe he just wanted to see you in your dress uniform. It does show off your figure.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : What is this I hear about you and Shakaar?</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : I don't know what you've heard.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : First it was Vedek Bareil and now it's the head of the Bajoran government. You do like powerful men, don't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : First of all, Shakaar's an old friend. Second of all, what <i>  business </i> is it of yours?</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : Let's just say it's further incentive for me to regain my former position.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Return to Grace[4.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Tora Ziyal </b> : You don't like my father very much, do you?</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : No, I don't.</dd><dd> <b>  Tora Ziyal </b> : I understand. He did some very bad things during the occupation.</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : Yes, he did.</dd><dd> <b>  Tora Ziyal </b> : It bothers him, you know?</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : <i>  [Disbelieving] </i> Does it?</dd><dd> <b>  Tora Ziyal </b> : Very much. He talks about it sometimes. He'd never admit it to anyone else, but he thinks the Occupation was a mistake.</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : Somehow, I don't think he'd say that if the Cardassians had won.</dd><dd> <b>  Tora Ziyal </b> : Maybe not, but maybe losing made him a better person.</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : Well, then a lot of innocent people died for his education.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Return to Grace[4.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : You judge me too harshly. Maybe I am seeking to regain my former position, one which I earned through hard work, dedication, and sacrifice, but redemption is not my sole motivation. I care about my people and I don't intend to allow the Klingons to get away with murdering them. I'm a much more complicated man than you give me credit for.</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : Well, if that's true, I suppose I prefer simpler men.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : Like Shakaar? It amazes me that a woman as intelligent and sophisticated as you could be attracted to such a lumbering, simplistic fieldhand. I mean, what could the two of you possibly talk about?</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : That lumbering fieldhand is the First Minister of Bajor, and he knows more about how to talk to me than you ever will.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : How can you be so sure? After all, you don't know me well enough to make a comparison.</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : I don't want to know you well enough. And if you want to keep working with me, I suggest you stick to business.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : I'm sorry, Major. I didn't mean any harm. I was just making conversation.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Return to Grace[4.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : Major, is it my imagination, or do you have a hard time accepting compliments?</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : I have a hard time accepting compliments from 'you'.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : Well, I'll try to restrain my enthusiasm <i>  [Leans in and whispers] </i> but I can't make you any promises.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Return to Grace[4.14]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Dukat has asked Kira to join him in his fight against the Klingons] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : You know how to organize a resistance cell, you're an expert at terrorist tactics, you have close ties with Bajoran and Federation officials and besides all that, it would give you a chance to do what you were meant to do.</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : No thanks. I've already got a job.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : What do you mean? On that space station? We both know your talents are being wasted there, co-ordinating docking assignments and leading training exercises. On Deep Space Nine you're nothing but a bureaucrat, an administrator. If you come with me, you can be a soldier again. Think about it, Major, the chance to fight again against a superior foe in a righteous cause, to protect a defeated and broken people from a cruel aggressor. You know as well as I do that if Cardassia falls, Bajor is next. Help me stop the Klingons before you become their next target.</dd><dd> <b>  Kira Nerys </b> : You're really serious about this.</dd><dd> <b>  Gul Dukat </b> : Absolutely! Look, Major, I'm not asking you to like me or to be my friend. I'm asking you to join me, to fight at my side. You know what I'm doing is right, and it's what you want to do as well. I know that our past makes it difficult for you to accept me as an ally. I also know that every fiber of your being is telling you to say "No, No, No," but somewhere I know there's a "Yes." You need to listen to that "Yes," not for my sake, not for Cardassia's, not even for Bajor's, but for your sake.</dd></dl>

Dermatalogically speaking you're perfectly healthy.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : Oh, I'm perfectly healthy, except I've got a disgusting cyst on the back of my neck. Now either I paint a nose, eyes, and mouth on it and pretend I've got two heads or you take it off.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : I'll get you some paint.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : Julian!

<dl><dd> <i>  [O'Brien is preparing to commit suicide] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : Chief?</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : Get outta here, Julian.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : You don't want to do this, Chief.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : The hell I don't.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : Look, I don't claim to know what you're going through, but whatever it is, it's not worth dying for.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : You don't understand at all. I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing it to protect Keiko and Molly and everyone else on this station.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : Protect us from what?</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : From me. I'm not the man I used to be. I'm dangerous. I nearly hit Molly today. All she wanted was a little attention, and I nearly hit her.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : But you didn't. You're a good man, Miles Edward O'Brien, and whatever it is you think you've done wrong, you don't deserve to die.</dd></dl>

Season 4
For the Cause[4.22]
<dl><dd> <i>  [Eddington has joined the Maquis] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Michael Eddington </b> : I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you. And yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands, and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators so that one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious... you assimilate people and they don't even know it.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : You know what, Mr. Eddington... I don't give a damn what you think of the Federation, or the Maquis, or anything else. All I know is that you betrayed your oath, your duty and me. And if it takes me the rest of my life, I'll see you standing before a court-martial that'll break you and send you to a penal colony where you'll spend the rest of your days growing old and wondering whether a ship full of replicators was really worth it.</dd></dl>

To the Death[4.23]
<dl><dd> <b>  Weyoun </b> : Captain Benjamin Sisko. Your psychological profile is required reading for Vorta Field Supervisors.

No President, no Starfleet Chief of Staff, just you.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : I'd say your psychological profile of me isn't as good as you think.</dd></dl>

I'm glad I'm not a Jem'Hadar woman.</dd><dd> <b>  Virak'kara </b> : There are no Jem'Hadar women.</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : So, what do you do? Lay eggs?</dd><dd> <b>  Virak'kara </b> : Jem'Hadar are bred in birthing chambers. We can fight within three days of our emergence.</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : So, no sleep, no food, no women. After forty or fifty years of that, I'd be ready to kill someone too.</dd><dd> <b>  Virak'kara </b> : No Jem'Hadar has ever lived fifty years. Most of us only last a few years in battle.</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : Well, how old are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Virak'kara </b> : I am eight.</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : I would have thought you were at least fifteen.</dd><dd> <b>  Virak'kara </b> : Few Jem'Hadar live that long. Those of us that reach twenty are considered honored elders.</dd><dd> <i>  [leans in] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Virak'kara </b> : How old are you?</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : I stopped counting after three hundred.</dd><dd> <b>  Virak'kara </b> : ...You don't look it.</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : Thank you.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : I was looking forward to tomorrow - to see Kira again, asking, "How was the nebula? And by the way, I cured that blight thing those people had."</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : It's not a crime to believe in yourself.</dd><dd> <b>  Julian Bashir </b> : These people believed in me, and look where it got them. Trevian was right: there is no cure. The Dominion made sure of that, and I was so arrogant, I thought I could find one in a week!</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : Maybe it was arrogant to think that. But it's even more arrogant to think that there isn't a cure just because <i>  you </i> couldn't find it.</dd></dl>

You didn't want to be phasered because you need a body. The knife was too savage, the nerve gas smelled bad, hanging took too long, and poison...what was was wrong with poison?</dd><dd> <b>  Quark </b> : It doesn't work. If I know the food is poisoned I won't eat it.</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : For someone who wants to die you're strangely intent on living.</dd><dd> <b>  Quark </b> : I'm going to die, don't you worry about that. I just don't want to see it coming, or hear it, or taste it, or smell it.</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : I see. You want to be surprised.</dd><dd> <b>  Quark </b> : I want to wake up in the divine treasure and have no idea how I got there.</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : That can be arranged.</dd></dl>

Broken Link[4.26]
<dl><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : It's funny. I've served on half a dozen different ships and none of them have had cloaking devices except the Defiant. Now that we're not using it, I feel naked.</dd><dd> <b>  Worf </b> : It is disconcerting, to say the least.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : Gentlemen, I feel the same breeze you do.</dd><dd> <i>  [Dax smiles] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : What are you smiling at?</dd><dd> <b>  Jadzia Dax </b> : I don't know, I guess it's just being in the same room as so many naked men.</dd></dl>

Apocalypse Rising[5.1]
<dl><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : So, let me get this straight: all we have to do is get past an enemy fleet, avoid a tachyon detection grid, beam into the middle of Klingon headquarters and avoid the Brotherhood of the Sword long enough to set these things up and activate them in front of Gowron?</dd><dd> <b>  Worf </b> : If we succeed, there will be many songs sung in our honor.</dd><dd> <b>  Miles O'Brien </b> : Let's hope we're there to hear them.</dd></dl>
Season 5

<dl><dd> <b>  Martok </b> : <i>  [to Worf, before his wedding] </i> We are not accorded the luxury of choosing the women we fall in love with. Do you think Sirella is anything like the woman I thought I'd marry? She is a mercurial, arrogant, prideful woman who shares my bed far too infrequently for my taste. And yet... I love her deeply. We Klingons often tout our prowess in battle and our desire for honor and glory above all else... but how hollow is the sound of victory without someone to share it with. And Honor gives little comfort to a man alone in his home... and in his heart.</dd></dl>

In the Pale Moonlight[6.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : That was my first moment of real doubt, when I started to wonder if this whole thing was a mistake. So then I went back to my office. And there was a new casualty list waiting for me. People are dying out there, everyday! Entire worlds are struggling for their freedom, and here I am still worrying about the finer points of morality! No, I... I had to keep my eye on the ball, win the war, stopping the bloodshed, those were the priorities. So I pushed on, and every time another doubt appeared before me, I just found another way to shove it aside.</dd></dl>

In the Pale Moonlight[6.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : Where's Tolar?</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : I've locked him in his room. I've also given him the distinct impression that if he tries to force the door open, it may explode.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : I hope that's <i>  just </i> an impression.</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : It's best not to dwell on such minutiae.</dd></dl>
Season 6
In the Pale Moonlight[6.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : If you can let your anger subside for a moment, Captain, you will see that they did <i>  not </i> die in vain! The Romulans will enter the war!</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : There's no guarantee of that!</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : Oh, but I think there is. You see. When the Tal Shiar finishes examining the wreckage of Vreenak's shuttle, they'll find the burnt remnants of a Cardassian optolithic data rod that somehow miraculously survived the explosion. After painstaking forensic examination, they'll discover that the rod contains a recording of a high level Dominion meeting at which the invasion of Romulus was being planned.</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : And then they will discover that it is a fraud!</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : No, but I don't think that they will! Because any imperfections in the forgery will thought to be as a result of the explosion! So, with a seemingly legitimate rod in one hand, and a dead senator in the other, I ask you Captain, what conclusions would you draw?</dd><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : <i>  [sighs] </i> That Vreenak obtained the rod on Zukara, and that the Dominion killed him to prevent him from returning to Romulus with it.</dd><dd> <b>  Elim Garak </b> : Precisely. And the more they deny it, the more the Romulans will think that they are guilty because it is exactly what they would have done in their place. [ <i>  pauses </i> ]That's why you came to me. Isn't it, Captain? Because you knew I could do those things that you weren't capable of doing. Well, it worked. And you'll get what you want: a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant. And in the end all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal, and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer. I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain.</dd></dl>
Season 6
In the Pale Moonlight[6.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Benjamin Sisko </b> : At 0800 Hours station time, the Romulan Empire formally declared war on the Dominion. They have already struck fifteen bases along the Cardassian border. So this is a huge victory for the good guys! This may even be the turning point of the entire war. There is even a 'Welcome to the Fight' party tonight in the ward room. So... I lied; I cheated; I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men; I am an accessory to murder. But the most damning thing of all is... I think I can live with it. And if I'd have to do it all over again... I would. Garak was right about one thing...a guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant. So I will learn to live with it...because I can live with it. [ <i>  pauses </i> ] I can live with it. [ <i>  pauses </i> ] Computer, erase that entire personal log.</dd></dl>
