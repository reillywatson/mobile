Season 2
Vows
<dl><dd> <i>  [About the medieval coin that launched Xanatos' fortune.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Petros Xanatos </b> : An anonymous stranger sends you a museum piece worth a fortune.

Season 2
Vows
<dl><dd> <b>  Petros Xanatos </b> : What are you hatching now?</dd><dd> <b>  David Xanatos </b> : That envelope contains my personal instructions for the Illuminati Society, plus two smaller sealed envelopes. The Society is to wait one thousand years, and then deliver the first envelope to a young David Xanatos of Bar Harbor, Maine. That envelope contains one of the coins Prince Malcolm gave me earlier. It's practically worthless now in 975 AD, but by 1975, it will be worth about... twenty grand. The second envelope is to be delivered twenty years after the first. It contains a detailed account of how the coin was obtained. That's how I knew how to set this all up: I received instructions from myself last week. So you see, Pop, I am, indeed, a self-made man.</dd></dl>

Season 2
The Cage
<dl><dd> <i>  [The Mutates debate on whether Sevarius has created a cure or poison.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Maggie </b> : It <i>  is </i> the cure!

You turned me into a monster and I <i>  defended </i> you--!</dd><dd> <i>  [A laser blast from a Steel Clan robot prevents him from approaching Xanatos.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  David Xanatos </b> : <i>  [to Talon] </i> I'm sorry it had to turn out this way. We all would've been more comfortable if you'd remained in the dark, but I can't let you damage Anton. He's a bit of a bother, but his mind contains <i>  infinite </i> possibilities.

Season 2
The Price
<dl><dd> <b>  Hudson </b> : A friendly word of advice. True immortality isn't about living forever, man: It's about what you do with the time you have. When all your scheming's done, what will be your legacy, Xanatos?</dd></dl>

Season 2
Grief
<dl><dd> <b>  Emir </b> : Hear me, guardian of the gate. I demand a favour.</dd><dd> <b>  Anubis </b> : I grant but one boon, mortal. And it will be given to you as it is given to everyone: when your time has come.</dd><dd> <b>  Emir </b> : You took from me my only son, Anubis - two years ago, in a pointless car accident.</dd><dd> <b>  Anubis </b> : Death is always pointless. <i>  That </i> is the point.</dd><dd> <b>  Emir </b> : Don't toy with me, Jackal God! I want my son back. I will make you give him back.</dd><dd> <b>  Anubis </b> : What you ask is unthinkable. Your son has passed. Let him rest. Death comes to us all.</dd><dd> <b>  Emir </b> : Not anymore! With you trapped here forever, death has no sting. No one can die. And so my threat is very real!</dd></dl>
Season 2
Grief
<dl><dd> <b>  Emir </b> : I demand reparation! My son was cruelly and unfairly taken from me!</dd><dd> <b>  Anubis </b> : On the contrary, death is the ultimate fairness. Rich and poor, young and old - all are equal in death. You would not like to see the Jackal God play favourites. Think what you are doing: all over the world there is birth, but no death. Our planet cannot support so many lives at once.</dd></dl>

Season 2
Grief
<dl><dd> <b>  Anubis/Jackal </b> : Life and death at my command... I <i>  like </i> it!</dd><dd> <b>  Emir </b> : No! <i>  I </i> was to be the avatar!</dd><dd> <b>  Anubis/Jackal </b> : You know, I think I'll keep you alive, to watch as <i>  all </i> life on this planet withers and dies.

Season 2
Grief
<dl><dd> <i>  [After the Emir becomes Anubis' avatar to stop the destruction Jackal caused, he begins to make the temple collapse] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Goliath </b> : What will you do now, Anubis?

Season 2
Grief
<dl><dd> <i>  [Goliath muses about the Emir's death.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Goliath </b> : If there's any justice in this world and the next, I'd say he's with son, at rest.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Eye of the Storm
<dl><dd> <b>  Goliath </b> <i>  [feeling around his neck] </i> : The eye. Where is the eye?</dd><dd> <b>  Odin </b> : Where it always belonged, gargoyle - with the original owner. I apologize for any trouble I caused in my efforts to reclaim it. It seems I'm out of practice dealing directly with mortals.</dd><dd> <b>  Goliath </b> : I owe you an apology as well. It seems I am unaccustomed to dealing with a god.... or being one.</dd><dd> <b>  Odin </b> : Then we have all gained rare enlightment this night: the eye's standard gift.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Sentinel
<dl><dd> <b>  Elisa Maza </b> : That's some story all right. Gargoyle clans , mutated brothers , magic spells . You threw in everything but King Arthur and the Holy Grail .</dd><dd> <b>  Goliath </b> : Yes, well, we haven't encountered the Holy Grail... yet.</dd></dl>

No machine can hold me!</dd><dd> <b>  David Xanatos </b> : This one can. Ever heard of the Cauldron of Life ? It was supposed to grant me immortality but it fell short of my expectations. I couldn't see such a rare find going to waste, though, so I melted it down and used it to reconstruct Coyote. <i>  My </i> Coyote. The magic inherent in the iron allows him to hold you.
