I'm starting to get a little cheesed at people telling me the reason I don't like soccer is that I don't understand it. I think I do understand it. I think I understand it just fine. I just happen to think it's a mind-numbing bore, and that any reasonable person would rather be playing it than watching it.</dd><dd> <b>  Casey </b> : Well I know it doesn't match the pulse-pounding excitement of a good sailboat race.</dd><dd> <b>  Dan </b> : Alright, nobody move.

I was just reading this <i>  New York Times </i> piece on the forensic evidence, the ballistics match, the eye-witnesses, and the 78 hours worth of wire-taps, a portion of which included the defendant saying "I killed him, I killed him, I killed him dead", and was wondering what a fella has to do to get thrown in jail on your watch?</dd><dd> <b>  Gordon </b> : How 'bout I run you through an IRS audit and we find out?</dd><dd> <b>  Casey </b> : You got nothin' on me, counselor; I live my life as clean as my mother's kitchen floor.</dd><dd> <b>  Gordon </b> : Really?

Season 1
Thespis[1.08]

Dan already folded the six you needed, and I have the other one. You don't have a house of any sort, you don't have a pup tent. You've got trip sevens, and I have a straight. I want you to trust me right now. I want you to say to yourself, yeah, I've dated a string of jerks in my life, they were stupid, they were mean to me, but maybe this one's different. Maybe I should take a chance and not adopt the break-up-with-him-before-he-breaks-my-heart strategy. I want you to remember that when I started liking you, I didn't stop liking tennis. And I want you to know that I don' t think there's a woman in the world that you need to be threatened by, no matter how glamorous you think she is. But mostly, I want you to trust me, just once, when I tell you you have three sevens, and I have a straight.</dd></dl>

Season 1
The Six Southern Gentlemen of Tennessee[1.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Isaac </b> : Exaudio, comperio, conloquor. That's a Latin phrase that translates "To listen, to learn, to speak." Those words are carved into the stone arches that form the entrance to the undergraduate library at Tennessee Western University. This afternoon, an extraordinary young man named Roland Shepard made what had to have been an excrutiating decision. He said he wasn't playing football under a Confederate flag. Six of his teammates then chose not to let Shepard stand alone. And I choose to join them at this moment. In the history of the South, there's much to celebrate. And that flag is a desecration of all of it. It's a banner of hatred and separation. It's a banner of ignorance and violence and a war that pitted brother against brother, and to ask young black men and women, young Jewish men and women, Asians, Native Americans, to ask <i>  Americans </i> to walk beneath its shadow is a humiliation of irreducable proportions. And we all know it. Tennessee Western has produced some outstanding alumni in the past hundred years. People of wisdom and vision. Strength and compassion. One of them is Luther Sachs. Luther Sachs owns Continental Corp. Which owns the Continental Sports Channel, which you're watching right now. Luther Sachs is a generous alumni contributer to Tennessee Western, with a considerable influance over it's chancellor, Davis Blake, and it's board of trustees. Luther, you've got a phone call to make. You've go tot call Chancellor Blake, and tell him to take down that flag, or he can stop looking for your checks in the mail. You've got to put these young men back in a classroom. And I mean pronto. These boys are gonna make you proud one day, Luther. I challenge you to do the right thing. Not an unreasonable request to make of a man, who's alma mater declares, "Exaudio, comperio, conloquor." "To listen, to learn, to speak." In the meantime, God go with you, Roland Shepard, and you six Southern gentlemen of Tennessee. God's not done with any of you, yet.</dd></dl>

And I have to say, it's been my experience that men buy better cake than women. I've found that women tend to get these yogurt-frosted low-cal things laced with a rum and fruit concoction that make eating cake into something you do to be polite. So that's why I was asking what kind of cake you were planning on getting to celebrate Isaac returning from vacation.</dd><dd> <b>  Dana </b> : Wow. I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.
