Season 1: Signs and Portents
<dl><dd> <i>  [Opening credits voiceover.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jeffrey Sinclair </b> : It was the dawn of the third age of mankind, ten years after the Earth/Minbari war. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. It's a port of call, home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is <i>  Babylon 5 </i> .</dd></dl>

Sooner or later you have a species that will have a genetic or technological advantage and that species will always conquer a species without that advantage.

We have homo superior versus homo sapien, on a level playing field, homo superior wins everytime.</dd></dl>

It is the language of the heart and of the language of the soul; but always it is the same voice; it is the voice of our ancestors speaking through us, and the voice of our inheritors waiting to be born; it is the small still voice that says: "We are one." No matter the blood, no matter the skin, no matter the world, no matter the star. We are one. No matter the pain, no matter the darkness, no matter the loss, no matter the fear. We are one. Here, gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule: that we must be kind to one another.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheridan </b> : Because each voice enriches us and ennobles us, and each voice lost diminishes us.

<dl><dd> <b>  Londo Mollari </b> : Isn't it strange, G'Kar? When we first met I had no power and all the choices I could ever want.

<dl><dd> <b>  Stephen Franklin </b> : Can God make a rock so big, that even he can't lift it?</dd><dd> <b>  G'Kar </b> : Yes, I've heard it, but ...</dd><dd> <b>  Franklin </b> : What if that is the wrong question? I wonder if the right question is, can God create a puzzle so difficult, a riddle so complex, that even he can't solve it? What if that's <i>  us </i> ? Maybe a problem like this is God's way of doing to us a little of what we do to him?</dd></dl>

Now I would have to imagine at 100,000 credits a head every mercenary between here and Earth will be out looking to hunt you down. Am I clear Mr. Paretti?</dd><dd> <b>  Mr. Paretti </b> : As glass, Mr. Garibaldi.</dd><dd> <b>  Michael Garibaldi </b> : Good.
