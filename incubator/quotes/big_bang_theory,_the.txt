I would like to propose an experiment.</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : Hang on. I'm trying to see how long it takes a 500-kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my Cup o' Noodles.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I've done it. About two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : Wait, are you asking me out?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I was going to characterize it as the modification of our colleague-slash-friendship paradigm with the addition of a date-like component, but we don't need to quibble over terminology.</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : What sort of experiment?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : There's a generally accepted pattern in this area. I would pick you up. Take you to a restaurant. Then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Heart rate, pheromones, et cetera. Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : Why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : You mean kiss you now?</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Can you define the parameters of the kiss?</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : Closed-mouth but romantic.

The Fuzzy Boots Corollary[1.03]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your side.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Uh, let me ask you this: when I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : You might be bound by them right now.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or, through inaction, allowed a human being to come to harm?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Of course not.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would've been endangered?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Well, no.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : I smell robot.</dd></dl>

The Hamburger Postulate[1.05]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : What did Penny mean, "you'd make a cute couple"?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Well, I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, though somewhat less likely interpretation is that you could manufacture one. As in, "Oh, look, Leonard and Leslie made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb! Aren't they adorable?"</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down, then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her, Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out; but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out, and that she, Leslie, had turned me down, then she, Penny, could be offering me consolation - "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple..." - while thinking, "good, Leonard remains available."</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : You're a lucky man, Leonard.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : How so?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : You're talking to one of the three men in the Western Hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Well, what do you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : What are you doing?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter-cup of 2% milk, sat on <i>  this </i> end of <i>  this </i> couch, turned on BBC America, and watched <i>  Doctor Who </i> .</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Penny's still sleeping.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal...</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : You have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Dumpling Paradox[1.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Sheldon, think this through. You're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and HALO 3. As far as I know sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapons systems.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : My point.</dd></dl>

And would you make it Diet?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : There's a can in the fridge.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : A Cuba Libre generally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Then swim to Cuba .</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.</dd></dl>

Season 1
The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization[1.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : The only thing missing from that slam was your mama!</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Hey Leonard, yo mama 's research methodology's so flawed...</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Shut up Howard! Sheldon, we have to do this.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : No we don't. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying. Everything else is optional.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization[1.09]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesize facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.</dd></dl>

The Loobenfeld Decay[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : What was I supposed to say?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : You could have told her the truth.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : That would have hurt her feelings.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Is that a relevant factor?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : And what would I have said afterwards?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I would suggest something to the effect of: singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree I'd recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumor pressing on the cognitive processing centers of your brain.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I couldn't say that. I would have to say, "you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again."</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Why?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : That's the social protocol. It's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I was not aware of that.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Now you are.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Oh. All right. Leonard?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Yes?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Loobenfeld Decay[1.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : How?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Simple: If she were to log onto www dot socalphysicsgroup dot org forward slash activities forward slash other, click on "Upcoming Events", scroll down to "Seminars", download the PDF schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Pancake Batter Anomaly[1.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Checkmate.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Argh, again?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Obviously you're not well-suited for three-dimensional chess. Perhaps three-dimensional Candyland would be more your speed.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Bat Jar Conjecture[1.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team, and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Well, thanks for the heads up.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Oh, one more thing...

The answer to the question, "Who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?".</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Yes! Well, I'm polymerized tree sap and you're an inorganic adhesive, so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you.</dd><dd> <b>  Leslie </b> : <i>  [sarcastically] </i> Ooooh...ouch.</dd></dl>

She thinks she's funny, but frankly, I've never been able to see it.</dd><dd> <b>  Missy </b> : That's because you have no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : How exactly would one measure a sense of humor? A 'humormometer'?</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Shiksa Indeterminacy/The Porkchop Indeterminacy[1.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?</dd><dd> <b>  Missy </b> : I guess.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : We Indians invented them.

Would you like to come?</dd><dd> <b>  Missy </b> : God yes. Thanks.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : You're welcome.</dd></dl>
Season 1
The Peanut Reaction[1.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : My parents focused on celebrating achievements, and my being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : That's so silly.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : It's actually based on very sound theories; his mother published a paper on it.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : What was it called, <i>  I Hate My Son and That's Why He Can't Have Cake </i> ?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : It was obviously very effective. Leonard grew up to become an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she also denied him Christmas, he'd be a little better at it.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Thank you.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Well, I love birthdays: waking up to mom's special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends...</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Yeah!

Season 2
The Bad Fish Paradigm[2.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Has Leonard ever dated any regular girls?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Well, I assume that you're not talking about digestive regularity, because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : No, I mean has he ever dated someone who wasn't a brainiac?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Oh, well there was this one girl who had a PhD in French Literature.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : How is that not a brainiac?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Well, for one thing, she <i>  was </i> French.

Season 2
The Codpiece Topology[2.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and say "Howdy."</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Bosoms would not have said "howdy" in the 15th century.

And we've only been seeing each other a few weeks.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : You don't see it, do you? We're losing her.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : OK, I'm going to make this very simple. You... are not in this relationship. I... am! Ergo, you have noooo say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I'm afraid I can't allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104, Section A, you are deemed unfit, and I hereby relieve you of your command.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Give me one good reason why not.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Because this is not Star Trek !</dd></dl>

I'll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : It's not enough that you made me watch that movie , but now you mock me with it?!</dd></dl>

The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis[2.11]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn't want to go out with me because I was too smart for you. Well, newsflash, Lady. David Underhill is ten times smarter than me. You'd have to drive a railroad spike in his brain for me to beat him at checkers. Next to him, I am like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes. So my question is, what's up with that?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : <i>  [crying] </i> Why are you yelling at me?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Sorry! I'm sorry sorry. Never mind. We're cool.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Dave is not smarter than you. He's an idiot.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : <i>  [chuckling] </i> Really? Why would you say that?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Because. A smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : He tried to take nude photos of you?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : <i>  [screaming] </i> That's what you took from that?!

But look, he signed it!</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Do you realize what this means?!?! All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Killer Robot Instability[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I'm given to understand that your mother is overweight.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Oh, snap.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Now of course if that is a result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : What difference does it make, fat is fat!</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : There are <i>  boundaries </i> !</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Killer Robot Instability[2.12]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow. Our engineer is incapacitated.</dd><dd> <b>  Barry </b> : What's wrong with him?</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : He's depressed, because he's pathetic and creepy and can't get girls.</dd><dd> <b>  Barry </b> : We're all pathetic and cweepy and can't get girls. That's why we fight wobots. If you're not there, you'll be subject to widicule.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : <i>  [addressing Barry's speech impediment] </i> I'm just curious, what part of America is that accent from?</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Friendship Algorithm[2.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Gentlemen, I put it to you: the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavor.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : First off, that's axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Friendship Algorithm[2.13]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : What about Howard and Raj, how did [Sheldon] become friends with them?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I don't know...how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Well yeah sure, when you put it that way.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Financial Permeability[2.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I see no large upcoming expenditures, unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with Adamantium like Wolverine.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Are they really working on that?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I sincerely hope so.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Financial Permeability[2.14]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : <i>  [to Sheldon, Howard, and Raj, who have come to assist him in getting money that Penny's ex-boyfriend owes her] </i> Now, we all know the plan?</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Yes. Koothrapalli's going to wet himself, I'm going to throw up, Sheldon's going to run away, and you're going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Excuse me, there are four of us and one of him.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <i>  [After Sheldon has described who/what he thinks Leonard is talking to/about due to Leonard's behavior while on the phone] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Yes, I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : My mother's coming for a visit.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Hey, how about that. You were right.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Maternal Capacitance[2.15]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : <i>  [about Leonard] </i> My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an overdeveloped sex drive.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard's mother </b> : Oh, I don't see where he could have gotten that. Besides a pro forma consummation of marriage, his father and I had intercourse only with the purpose of reproduction.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard's mother </b> : Yes, we think so. We've both made papers on it. Mine from a neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine of course was the only one worth reading.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Of course, I would very much like to read about your sex life.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard's mother </b> : Well, it's all online, or you can order it from the Princeton University press.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Here is your tea, mother. What are you guys talking about?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Swell. If you are lucky she might show you the PowerPoint presentation.</dd><dd> <i>  [Sheldon looks thrilled] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Leonard's mother </b> : I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Ohhhh.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Cushion Saturation[2.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : That is my spot. In an ever-changing world it is a simple point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function in a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot, at the moment I first sat on it, would be [0,0,0,0].</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Cushion Saturation[2.16]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Do you know what baffles me, Sheldon?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Based on your academic record, a number of things, I would imagine.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Terminator Decoupling[2.17]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : <i>  [about  Summer Glau  ] </i> I have eleven hours with her in a confined space. Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train and tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.</dd><dd> <i>  [pause] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : My money's on tuck and roll.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Work Song Nanocluster[2.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Hey! You know what'd be a great idea: we get some girls over here and play laser-obstacle-strip-chess...</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that you don't want to see naked.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : You underestimate me.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Work Song Nanocluster[2.18]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I'm a physicist.

The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition[2.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : So there <i>  is </i> a number?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Okay, new topic, please.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition[2.19]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Typical.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : It's axiomatically atypical. Up until recently they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in her previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants. So your characterization of their behavior as typical is demonstrably fallacious.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : <i>  [referring to his earlier impersonation of  Admiral Ackbar  ] </i> OK, now I see the squid head.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Hofstadter Isotope[2.20]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics chatroom and I need your help.</dd><dd> <b>  Stuart </b> : Oh, yeah, those guys can be very stubborn. What's the topic?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I am asserting, in the event that Batman 's death proves permanent, the original Robin , Dick Grayson , is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.</dd><dd> <b>  Stuart </b> : Oooh! Sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong!</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : "More" wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and is not subject to gradation.</dd><dd> <b>  Stuart </b> : Of course it is. It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable. It's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge !</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Hofstadter Isotope[2.20]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I thought you said you were good at this! You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women!</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : I do, all the time!</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Well what happened? We've been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you had was when your mom called.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Wow, you're just gonna make me come out and say it aren't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Say what?</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : You're weighing me down! I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Fine, I'll sit here, you take flight and hunt.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Don't be ridiculous, you can't just <i>  tell </i> a falcon when to hunt!</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Actually, you can. There's a whole sport built around it. FALCONRY !</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Shut up.</dd></dl>

Season 2
The Classified Materials Turbulence[2.22]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : You have to check your messages Leonard! The leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy!</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : It must be hell inside your head.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : <i>  [pause] </i> At times.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Classified Materials Turbulence[2.22]
<dl><dd> <b>  Stuart </b> : Sheldon, here is the new edition of Hellboy. It's mind blowing.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Ex <i>  cuse </i> me. Spoiler alert!</dd><dd> <b>  Stuart </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : You told me "it's mind blowing". So my mind goes into it "pre-blown". Once your mind is "pre-blown", it cannot be "re-blown".</dd><dd> <b>  Stuart </b> : <i>  [Bewildered] </i> I'm sorry.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Said the Grinch to Christmas.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Monopolar Expedition[2.23]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : You guys are seriously considering this?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Yes!</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : <i>  [incredulous] </i> And you think you can put up with Sheldon?</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Well, I'm a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life, we will be rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with <i>  wings </i> !</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Monopolar Expedition[2.23]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Leonard, I don't know what to tell you; it was just a hug.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Glad we cleared that up.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Yeah.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I guess I'll see you.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : OK, have a safe trip.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Thank you. Bye.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Bye. <i>  [closes her door and sighs] </i> It means I wish you weren't going.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation[3.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : No, mother, I cannot feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I'm home safe does not prove that it worked. That logic is <i>  post hoc, ergo propter hoc </i> . <i>  [lowers his voice] </i> No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation[3.01]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : What are they doing here?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : We came to apologize again and bring you home. So why don't you pack up your stuff, and we'll head back?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over, and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.</dd><dd> <b>  Mrs. Cooper </b> : You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone's entitled to their opinion.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.</dd><dd> <b>  Mrs. Cooper </b> : And that is your opinion.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : <i>  [to the guys] </i> I forgive you, let's go home.</dd><dd> <i>  [Sheldon leaves to pack] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Mrs. Cooper </b> : <i>  [smiling] </i> Don't tell <i>  me </i> prayer doesn't work.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Jiminy Conjecture[3.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : What's the matter? You chicken?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I've always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbor's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Chickens can't climb trees.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Thank God.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Jiminy Conjecture[3.02]
<dl><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : <i>  [checking an encyclopedia] </i> Right here. See it? The common field cricket, a.k.a. <i>  Gryllus Assimilis </i> , which is Latin for "Suck it. You lose."</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Hang on. <i>  [Finds another page] </i> Voila. The Snowy Tree Cricket, a.k.a. <i>  Oecanthus fultoni </i> , which is Latin for "I'll suck nothing." Of course I'm joking because the Latin for that is <i>  Nihil exsorbibo </i> .</dd></dl>
Season 3

Season 3
The Gothowitz Deviation[3.03]

Season 3
The Pirate Solution[3.04]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I've always been a little confused about this -- why don't Hindus eat beef?</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : We believe cows are gods.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Not technically. In Hinduism cattle are thought to be <i>  like </i> gods.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Do not tell me about my own culture Sheldon! In the mood I'm in I'll take you out, I swear to cow!</dd></dl>
Season 3

She might be dying. I wouldn't want to miss that. But on the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.</dd><dd> <b>  Bernadette </b> : I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Not as crazy as my mother makes me.</dd><dd> <b>  Bernadette </b> : Oh, yeah, does your mother call you every day at work to see if you've had a healthy lunch?</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.</dd></dl>

The Cornhusker Vortex[3.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Alright, Poindexter, sit down, shut up, and listen.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I'm sorry?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Oh, that's how my father always began our football conversations, and if you'd like, after the game I'll take you outside and teach you to shoot close enough to a raccoon that it craps itself.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Cornhusker Vortex[3.06]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : I think I'm starting to get this.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : Really? The only thing I've learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often, and have trouble getting erections.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.</dd><dd> <b>  Raj </b> : I'm just saying, maybe if people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Guitarist Amplification[3.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! "Damn it, George, I told you if you didn't quit drinkin', I'd leave you!" <br /> "Well, I guess that makes you a liar, 'cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here!" <br /> "Stop yelling! You're making Sheldon cry!" <br /> "I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon!"</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Guitarist Amplification[3.07]
<dl><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Come on Sheldon, let's go home - we're done fighting.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I've heard that before. Then the next thing you know I'm hiding in my bedroom blaring a Richard Feynman lecture while my mom is shouting that "Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf." And my dad's on the roof skeet shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : There's gonna be no more shouting and no skeet shooting.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Really? Where's your friend Justin going to sleep?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Yeah, where's he gonna sleep?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Oh, my God, would you let this go?!</dd><dd> <b>  Stuart </b> : <i>  [walking by] </i> I'd let it go.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Why do I have to let it go, why can't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?! <i>  [Sheldon interrupts with his toy robot] </i> Oh, for God's sakes! <i>  [turns off the robot] </i> So, you have childhood issues - we all have childhood issues. At some point you just need to grow up and get past them.</dd><dd> <i>  [Sheldon holds up another robot] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? <i>  [takes robot from Sheldon and turns it off] </i> Sheldon, please, try and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we're gonna fight. But - no matter what happens between us, we'll always love you. Right, Leonard?</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Always is a long time. <i>  [both look at him] </i> Sure, always.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : You know, how 'bout we buy you this robot and we all go home.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : I want that one.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Okay, we'll buy you that one.</dd><dd> <b>  Leonard </b> : Ah, come on, he's just gonna play with it twice and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk.</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Buy him the robot, Leonard. <i>  [he walks off to buy the robot] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Can I get this comic book too?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : <i>  [mom-like tone and face] </i> Yes you can. <i>  [he runs off] </i></dd></dl>

Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise, he was a science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise's 'Check Engine' light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Howard?</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : Yeah?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?</dd><dd> <b>  Howard </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Bazinga! I don't care!</dd></dl>
Season 3
The Gorilla Experiment[3.10]
<dl><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Why are you crying?</dd><dd> <b>  Penny </b> : Because I'm stupid.</dd><dd> <b>  Sheldon </b> : Well, that's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid, and that makes me sad.</dd></dl>

The Maternal Congruence[3.11]
