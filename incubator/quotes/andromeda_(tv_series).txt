Unfortunately, one of them is slowly starving to death and the other one is out betryaying us.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : We don't know that.</dd><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : Well, somehow, I don't think Tyr took all of our guns for Nietzschean "Show and Tell".</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : With Tyr, you never know.</dd></dl>
Second Season
"Heart for Falsehood Framed"
<dl><dd> <b>  Rommie </b> : Peerpoint Drift is a den of thevies. I say let the Than blow them up.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Well, that is why <i>  you </i> are not conducting the negotiations.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Beetle </b> : Make me an offer.</dd><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : I offer not to pull your heart out through your eye socket and nail it to your forehead.</dd><dd> <b>  Beetle </b> : That's very reasonable. How's noon tomorrow?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : <i>  (about the Than and Chichin in negotiations) </i> Would you like me to kill them for you?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : <i>  (weary) </i> Yes. <i>  (Tyr moves toward the door) </i> Wait I'm just kidding.

I mean I assume you could tell the difference the whole time.</dd><dd> <b>  Rommie </b> : Of course. Harper is sweet, but he still believes pretty much anything I tell him. <i>  (as if to Harper) </i> Oh, I'm sorry.

Second Season
"Pitiless as the Sun"
<dl><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : Am I mistaken, sir, or did you just grant complete strangers unlimited access to this ship?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Why, yes, I did. That way, we can monitor them closely and see what they do with it. There's something not quite trustworthy about them, don't you think?</dd><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : Your occasional bouts of deviousness never fail to surprise me, Captain.</dd></dl>

Second Season
"Una Salus Victus"
<dl><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : You're right. This might have been easier had we been able to follow your plan.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Damn! That was almost an apology!</dd><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : It was nothing of the sort.</dd></dl>
Second Season
"Into the Labyrinth"
<dl><dd> <b>  Charlemagne Bolivar </b> : There are at least three good reasons you shouldn't let the Sabra-Jaguar Pride join your new Commonwealth: We are renowned for our treachery; we are at war with the Drago-Kazov Pride; and we will constantly remind you of your genetic inferiority.

Second Season
"Into the Labyrinth"
<dl><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : What would you like, Jaguar?</dd><dd> <b>  Charlemagne </b> : The usual: Hundreds of grandchildren, utter domination of known space, and the pleasure of hearing that all my enemies have died in terrible, highly improbable accidents that cannot be connected to me.

Second Season
"Bunker Hill"

Second Season
"Bunker Hill"
<dl><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : Uh, Dylan, now would be the time for one of those crazy, desperate, this-just-might-work ideas.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Oh, I've got one, I was just hoping I wouldn't have to use it.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Trance </b> : She can't tell you.</dd><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : Why? Why can't I tell him?</dd><dd> <b>  Trance </b> : Because if you tell him, Tyr will die.</dd><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : Then, by all means, leave me in suspense.</dd></dl>
Second Season
"In Heaven Now Are Three"
<dl><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : The Engine of Creation is a myth. It's like the Holy Grail of ancient Earth, or the Wyvern's Hoards of Gehenna Mortis.</dd><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : Or a restored Commonwealth.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : <i>  [laughs, insincerely] </i> That's not funny.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : They're not butchers, just very strange lovers.</dd><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : Yeah, he's totally controlling, and she's this sexy, shoot-from-the-hip kinda gal. What could they possibly have in common?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Well, Harper always says that opposites attract.</dd><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : That's just his excuse to meet women.

Second Season

Second Season
"Belly of the Beast"
<dl><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : I once told Dylan that his mission to restore the Commonwealth is nothing more than an excuse to shape the Universe according to his will. It is. But, in the past two years, for reasons I cannot begin to understand, perhaps I have come to... prefer that shape?</dd></dl>

"Immaculate Perception"
<dl><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : So, if the Genite attacks are fake, then Tyr is working with the Drago-Kazovs? Nah, I don't buy it.</dd><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : But you buy the "warm and fuzzy" Tyr, concerned for his fellow Nietzscheans?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : No, I didn't say that.</dd></dl>
Second Season
"Immaculate Perception"

Third Season
"If the Wheel is Fixed" (Season Premiere)
<dl><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : Nice move, boss, the old slingshot maneuver. Plus a little luck.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Well, sometimes I think luck is just another word for "fate."</dd><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : Yeah, well, I'm feeling particularly fatalistic right now.</dd></dl>
Third Season
"If the Wheel is Fixed" (Season Premiere)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Why is it we look for luck every time we're in danger?</dd><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : Because that's when we need it most.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Well, the thing about luck is... the balance changes.</dd><dd> <b>  Trance </b> : What about fate?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Fate is a hunter.</dd></dl>

Third Season
"The Shards of Rimni"
<dl><dd> <b>  Rommie </b> : The Commonwealth is still hailing us, and they're mad. They say this is the last warning.</dd><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : That's what they said five "last warnings" ago.</dd><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : They're waiting for authorization. God bless bureaucracy!</dd></dl>
Third Season

<dl><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : <i>  [speaking of a mythical vase] </i> I mean, when I was little, my mom told me that it was so powerful that nobody could be trusted with it, not even Vedrans . Weren't you at least a little tempted to put it together and see what it did?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : <i>  [wording from  Shakespeare  's </i> The Merchant of Venice <i>  ] </i> Well, there's something else that <i>  my </i> mom taught me.

Third Season
"The Shards of Rimni"
<dl><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : So, uh, the vase. It doesn't do a thing, does it? It's worthless.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : It's a symbol. Zeus and Abelard believed that it would bring them power. But to me, it represents the highest confidence in faith that we all put in the Commonwealth.</dd><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : Well that's good. Cuz, three people murdered, one in jail collecting dust, and another one on the run with his gun in the sun for all eternity. A lot of time and energy wasted and all for a worthless hunk 'a glass... It <i>  is </i> worthless... right?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Did I say it was worthless? No. It's priceless. And isn't that the value of all dreams?</dd></dl>
Third Season
"Mad To Be Saved"
<dl><dd> <b>  Angelika </b> : Once you've lived an extended period of doing without, you never take having for granted.

When's the last time you lived without?</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Well, I uh... I had 303 years once, frozen in a black hole, doing without life or food.</dd></dl>
Third Season
"Mad To Be Saved"
<dl><dd> <b>  Oderic </b> : You know, if you weren't so intensely self-absorbed, you'd realize that all of life is a balance between the emptiness of eternity and the need to make art to remind ourselves we were here.</dd><dd> <b>  Tyr </b> : I had an epiphany like that once. Then I mercilessly beat someone until it went away.</dd></dl>
Third Season
"Mad To Be Saved"
<dl><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : <i>  [sarcastically] </i> Oh well you know me with percentages, Rommie. I like to take a big gamble every day because I might be walking around lucky and not even know it.</dd></dl>

Third Season

Third Season
"The Lone and Level Sands"
<dl><dd> <b>  Captain Metis </b> : <i>  [to Dylan] </i> You and I are cut from the same silk cloth. Men like you and me have a mission, a purpose, to lead, a chance to be great. Without them we'd be little more than madmen.</dd></dl>
Third Season
"The Lone and Level Sands"
<dl><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : Tell you what, Rommie - after we finally finish building our castle, and all the dragons have been slain, why don't we point out the farthest star, and see what's out there?

<dl><dd> <b>  Beka </b> : You know, ever since we reestablished the Commonwealth, I've been wondering; is it really necessary that we risk life and limb every time somebody gets in trouble?</dd><dd> <b>  Rommie </b> : We're the good guys, Beka. We fight the bad guys.</dd></dl>
Third Season
"Slipfighter the Dogs of War"

Third Season
"And Your Heart Will Fly Away"
<dl><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : I only need 20 more minutes.</dd><dd> <b>  Dylan </b> : You said that 20 minutes ago.</dd><dd> <b>  Harper </b> : Yeah, but that was before I knew I really only needed 20 more minutes.</dd></dl>
