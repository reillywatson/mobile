<dl><dd> <b>  Doyle </b> : Let me tell you a little bedtime story.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : But I don't feel sleepy.</dd><dd> <b>  Doyle </b> : Once upon a time, there was a vampire. And he was the meanest vampire in all the land. I mean, other vampires were afraid of him he was such a bastard. Then, one day, he gets his soul back and suddenly he's mad with guilt.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I was wrong. Now I'm feeling sleepy.</dd><dd> <b>  Doyle </b> : It's a fairly dull tale. It needs a bit of sex, in my opinion. So sure enough, he meets a girl. Pretty little blonde thing. A vampire slayer by trade. And our vampire falls madly in love. But eventually, they get fleshy with one another. And the moment he- well, I guess the technical term is "Perfect Happiness". But when our boy gets there, he goes bad and kills again. It's ugly. When he gets his soul back for the second time, he figures he can't be anywhere near Miss Puppy-Eyes without endangering them both. He takes off and goes to L.A, to fight evil and atone for his crimes. He's a shadow, a faceless champion of the helpless human race.

And the whole night I was bored silly. All I could think about was, if this wimp saw a monster, he'd probably throw a shoe at it and run like a weasle. Turns out, the shoe part was giving him too much credit.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : There aren't very many people who wouldn't run. It's just human nature.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Yeah. ... But all of a sudden "rich and handsome" isn't good enough for me. Now I expect a guy to be all brave and interesting. And it's your fault. Both of you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Well, maybe not. Maybe you're changing. That could be a good thing.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Or disastrous. As if I wasn't confused enough, then Doyle comes along and rescues me like some... badly dressed superhero. <i>  [Angel supresses smile] </i> He was really beat up.

Right?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Well, there's definitely more to Doyle than meets the eye.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : So I've gotta kill myself. <i>  [Angel stops smiling] </i> I swore, when I went down this road with Xander Harris , I'd rather be dead than date a fixer-upper again.... Still, maybe you're right. Maybe Doyle does have hidden depths. I mean, really, <i>  really </i> hidden. But depths!

Oh, and there was something in Boston in 1908, I think he was there, too.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : So you believe me.</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : Yes, I believe you...</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Good, because he's planning something el...</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : ...Angelus. Isn't that what he called you? Angelus? I looked it up, it's all right there. The demon with the face of an angel. A particularly brutal bastard, by all accounts. Oh, and no, you can't come in.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I can't make up for the past, Kate, I know that...</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : No, you can't. In fact, all of this? What's happening now? Is because of <i>  you </i> . You made him, didn't you?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Then let me help end it. Please.</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : 'Please.' Now there's a word I imagine you heard quite a lot in your time. 'Please.' 'No.' 'Don't.' Thanks for the offer, but I don't need your help. I know what to do. Drive a stake right through the son of a bitch's heart. And when that happens, I suggest you don't be there, because the next time we meet, I'll do the same to you.</dd></dl>

You looked into that mirror and all you saw was yourself. That's all you ever see, Rebecca, and that's what really frightens you.

Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Vampire </b> : How do you know I won't just kill you here, drain you and leave your body?</dd><dd> <i>  [Darla puts her purse down on the hood of a car and gives him a hard kiss, then steps back.

The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : What the hell do you think you're doing?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Saving you.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I wasn't <i>  in </i> any danger, Angelus.

I was saving you from yourself.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Who asked you?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : This isn't the answer.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : You don't even know what the question is. Why can't you leave me alone?</dd><dd> <i>  [She tries to walk past him but he stops her, leaning close into her face.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You do this thing and I won't be able to leave you alone, don't you get that?

I'm sorry, but I don't want that, not again.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Don't worry.

Try something on the westside, I guess.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Another dive, another loser?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : What do you care?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : This isn't you, Darla.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : You know, just because we had a thing for 150 years, don't presume you know me!</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel can't understand why Darla wants so badly to become a vampire again.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : So, you really want to be made by some creep in a filthy alley.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I wanted you to do it.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : That'll never happen.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : So I do what I have to do.

You've only been human again for a few months. Why not give it some time?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I don't have time.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You do. You've been given a second chance. Don't throw that away before you have the opportunity ...</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I'm dying.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : ... ... What?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Yeah. And not 'sometime.' Not 'later.' Now. Right now. They showed me the medical files. All the tests say the same thing.

Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <i>  [France 1765] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : How many men do you supposed he has with him?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I can't die.

They're men, mortals. Between the two of us we can go out with a reputation.

Of course it's a trick. They're trying to play some kind of mind game.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : To what end?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I don't know, but we're not gonna take the bait.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : No, you just don't wanna believe it, that's all.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I don't wanna believe anything from them.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : It's true. They can't really be trusted.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I don't trust them. But I know a thing or two about mind games. <i>  [To Angel] </i> So do you. We've played them together for over a century.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Yes, but you were just soulless, blood-sucking demons. They're lawyers.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : <i>  [to Darla] </i> She's right. We were amateurs.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <i>  [Angel has brought a terminally ill Darla to the Hyperion Hotel] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : <i>  [to Darla] </i> First up, you're a prisoner.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : I'd have to concur with that, yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : See, you've got our friend all in knots.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Can't say we like you much.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : So, sorry about the dying, but if you try to escape, we <i>  will </i> hit you.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : On the head.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : With very large and heavy objects.

Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <i>  [Darla has just told Angel that she is dying and he has kicked open Lindsey's door to confront him about this.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I may not be able to come in, Lindsey, but...</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Wipe your feet.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Wipe your feet. You can come in. Jeez, I invited you in already.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Yes, she's dying. Yes, those medical reports you saw are real. You want a second opinion? <i>  [Picks up some files and throws them at Angel] </i> Here. How about a thrid? Hmm? How about a tenth? I used every connection Wolfram and Hart had. <i>  [Points at the file Angel is looking at.] </i> That's my own personal doctor. They all say the same thing: syphilitic heart condition - terminal. <i>  [Refills his glass] </i> Looks like our Darla was a working girl in the New World. Syphilis was what she was dying from when she was human. Now she's human again. Kind of picking up where she left off. Of course, today something like that could be cleared up with a few antibiotics if you catch it in time. We're about a month and what? 400 years too late?</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : <i>  [About Darla] </i> Do you love her, Lindsey? <i>  [Lindsey looks down] </i> Is that what this is? Heh! Look at you. A few short months with her and you go all schoolboy. I was with her for <i>  150 </i> years.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : But you never loved her.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I wasn't capable of it and neither are you.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Maybe not. But I'd save her if I could. And you can. And you won't. So you got a choice pal: waste the last two months of her life searching for a cure that doesn't exist, watch her wither away and die...or you can use the only real power you got. You can make this disease go away today if you wanted to.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : By killing her again.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : By giving her life! Eternal life.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : And then what, Lindsey? You and her can be together? If I were to do it if I turned her, how long do think it would be before she hunted you down and had you for breakfast? I've got to say, I mean, that thought alone almost makes it worth it. But there is another way, and I'll find it.</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel throws the medical files at Lindsey and walks out.] </i></dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : <i>  [About Darla] </i> I'm sorry, but after 400 hundred years of death and destruction, seems to me, you get voted off the island. Am I right?</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : We'll find a cure. We'll do something.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : <i>  You'll </i> do something! Now, I've been around long enough to know when something is a lost cause. Unless...</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : That's exactly what they want us to do, Darla. We'd be playing right into their hands.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I don't care. I don't wanna die.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I can't give you what you want.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : It's what I need.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : No, it's not what you need, Darla. Really it's not. I don't know what you need. I wish I did.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : I don't know either.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : No. You do. You're the only one that could. You just can't see it that's all. You need a little help.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : <i>  [singing] </i> You're only misleading the sunshine I'm needing. Ain't that a shame? It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up from out of nowhere when love...</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Aren't you supposed to be reading her?</dd><dd> <b>  Lorne </b> : I'm a channel surfer. Look, you're a big hunk of hero sandwich. You wanna save the girl. I can see why. But you're missing the crucial point here. Things fall apart. Not everything can be put back together, no matter how much you want it.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : She's not gonna die.</dd><dd> <b>  Lorne </b> : Why do you care <i>  so </i> much? She had more than most of us, already 400 plus years.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : As a vampire. Before that she was... She... She never had a chance.</dd><dd> <i>  [Darla finishes her song to big applause.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Lorne </b> : Someone get my heart. That girl's ripped it right out.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What is this?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : I think you know, sir.</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel, breathing hard, is staring at the stakes. Darla, breathing hard, closes her eyes.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Stakes? You call this (starts coughing) a test? The only way this can work is you kill me, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Exactly. You do understand, this third test has no catch, as you will find out it. Death is the final challenge. We can't restore one life without taking another. You see? In order for Darla to live, you must die.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : I apologize for any discomfort this may be causing. I really - can't imagine the pain.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : How about we switch places and we won't have to, huh?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Oh, my death wouldn't balance a thing, sir. Yours on the other hand...</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I die, Darla lives?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Yes. I'm unaware of any deities the vampire worships, but if you'd like to pray... <i>  [pulls a lever and the stakes pull back, spring-loaded into place] </i> ...now would be the time.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <i>  [Angel stares at the stakes.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What are you waiting for?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : For you, sir. I can't proceed without your permission. You've earned a choice. Accept your death so she may live or...</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Or what?!</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Leave. Refuse the challenge and walk away. No one will stop you. Our doors are all open to you. You've done that yourself.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What about Darla?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Oh, she dies.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : No deal.</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : I expected as much. A pity. I'm beginning to like you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Spare me.</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : I'd very much like to. <i>  [Steps closer.] </i> Do you mind if I ask you a question? Isn't the world a better place with you in it? You can save so many people. It seems she can barely save herself.</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel doesn't answer. Darla has a tear in her eye.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : You know better than anyone the world can be a very bad place. Take yourself out, put her in - how long will it be before she stumbles, before she falls?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I don't know.</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : No, you don't. Are you still ready to give her life when she can promise you - nothing?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <i>  [Darla licks her lips and swallows.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : As you wish.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : No.</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel takes a deep breath.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Do it.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Trial
<dl><dd> <i>  [Jeeves releases the stakes and they hurtle towards Angel.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Noooooooooooooooo!</dd><dd> <i>  [She squirms, her eyes closed. She opens them to see Angel in front of her, once again fully dressed but panting, hunched over, barely able to stand.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Angel!</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Congratulations. You've passed the third test by accepting death. I'm told no one's ever gone that far before in terms of sacrifice. Kudos.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Pay up.</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Of course. <i>  [To Darla] </i> You're a lucky woman, and soon you'll have your whole life ahead. Use it wisely.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Hey, Jeeves, unless this fortune cookie crap is some new kind of torture, what you say we get on with it, huh?"</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : This way, miss.</dd><dd> <i>  [He puts his hands on the sides of her head and they both close their eyes as Angel tries to straighten up so he can get a better view. Jeeves opens his eyes and lets his hands drop.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Oh!</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : This is very embarrassing.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What is?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : Not to mention unprecedented. She's...she's been given new life once before by supernatural means, yes?"</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : They brought me back.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What are you saying?</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : I can't help you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : We had a bargain. She's earned a second chance.</dd><dd> <b>  Jeeves </b> : She's living her second chance. <i>  [The wall shivers and a set of stairs leading up appears.] </i> But you played the game magnificently. <i>  [Angel gives him a dark look and Jeeves adjusts his cuffs.] </i> Perhaps you should have told us that she was brought to life before this all started. I truly <i>  am </i> sorry, sir. The fact of the matter is... <i>  [Steps back and dissolves </i> ...there is nothing I can do.</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel doesn't move.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Angel...</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel reacts angrily.] </i></dd></dl>

The Trial
<dl><dd> <i>  [Angel and Darla are sitting in her dingy motel room, Darla on the bed, Angel on a chair by the door.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Maybe it would be different. We don't know. Maybe, uh... because, you know, I have a soul if...if I did bite you...</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : No!</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : We don't know what it would do to you.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Angel, I've seen it now. Everything you're going through, everything you've gone through. I felt it. I felt how you care. The way no one's ever cared before. Not for me. <i>  [Gives him a tiny smile] </i> That's all I need from you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : That's not enough.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : It is.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : How could the Powers allow you to be brought back, dangle a second chance and take it away like this?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Maybe this is my second chance.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : To die?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Yes. To die. The way I was supposed to die in the first place.</dd><dd> <i>  [They look at each other for a moment before Darla turns away drawing a shaky breath. Angel gets up and, still limping slightly, goes to sit next to her.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I'm not gonna leave you.</dd><dd> <i>  [Darla looks at him trying not to cry.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Every moment you have left I'm gonna be by your side.

Now this Drusilla vamp goes and bites Darla?</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : So it would seem.</dd><dd> <b>  Gunn </b> : Making her a vampire again.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : That's the cosmological upshot, yes. Darla's human self has died, and some time before dawn, unless Angel can stop it, she will rise again, a soulless demon.</dd><dd> <b>  Gunn </b> : So that means...</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Clock is ticking.</dd><dd> <b>  Gunn </b> : No, no, what I'm sayin' is, that means the granddaughter remade the grandmother.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Oh.

You've stolen files, co-operated with our enemy, disobeyed orders time and again. Mrs. Morgan...when you drove away the telekinetic Bethany Chaulk, you lost for us a powerful potential assassin. Not to mention the fact that both of you have been extremely negligent about informing us of visits form certain ladies who, lest we forget, <i>  ate </i> the majority of our contracts department. The truth is that neither one of you are particularly qualified to run the special projects division. As for your relationship to one another: your competition has been vicious, destructive and... <i>  healthy </i> . We think you keep each other on your toes.

I just wanna feel something besides the cold.</dd><dd> <i>  [Pushes her back onto a table, lowers himself on top of her and kisses her again.

Epiphany
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Oh, God.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Don't fight it, my love. Just let it happen. It'll only hurt for a minute.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Oh, God. Oh, God.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Yes. Yes, I know. It was the same for me. The soul is gone, but it leaves a bitterness. It'll pass. What you need is a fresh kill. Hot human blood will wash away the foul memory of it. I promise. What? What is it?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You saved me.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Yes. But I was going to kill you tonight. Take you out of this world, the same way I brought you into it. But I didn't have to. You gave yourself over so completely, Angelus. I felt you surrender.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I gave you everything I had left.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Yes.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I'm so sorry.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : You don't have to be.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : But I am. I am sorry.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I'm sorry Darla.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : <i>  [Realizes] </i> No!</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You saved me. Sorry I couldn't do the same for you.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Let go of me! You still have a soul!</dd></dl>

I meant her message pad.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Oh right, that's a good idea. <i>  [Picks up a pencil] </i> Oh, here. Use this you can make a rubbing of the impressions she left, see what the last thing was that she wrote.</dd><dd> <b>  Gunn </b> : Or we could just read the carbon.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : <i>  [Drops the pencil] </i> Or you can do that.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Epiphany
<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Guys, guys. Does it make sense that she would go there in the middle of the night, without calling either one of you?</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley and Gunn </b> : They owe us money.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Let's go.</dd></dl>
Season 2
Epiphany
<dl><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : I feel like such an idiot.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : A lot of that going around.</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : I just couldn't ... My whole life has been about being a cop. If I'm not a part of the force, it's like nothing I do means anything.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : It doesn't.</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : Doesn't what?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Mean anything. In the greater scheme, in the big picture, nothing we do matters. There's no grand plan, no big win.</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : You seem kind of chipper about that.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Well ... I guess I kind of worked it out. If there's no great glorious end to all this, if ... nothing we do matters ... then all that matters is what we do. 'Cause that's all there is. What we do. Now. Today. I fought for so long for redemption, for a reward, finally, just to beat the other guy. But I never got it.</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : Now you do?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Not all of it. All I want to do is help. I want to help because I don't think people should suffer as they do, because if there's no bigger meaning, then the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world.</dd><dd> <b>  Kate </b> : Yikes. Sounds like you've had an epiphany.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : That's what I keep saying, but nobody's listening.</dd></dl>

Sits down on a chair and looks at something in her hands.] </i> You should have told me what you had planned. I would have talked you out of it helped you. I don't know. <i>  [He closes the rest of the curtains, walks over to Darla.] </i> Things are getting complicated for us now.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Yes. Yes, I believe they are.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : We should probably clear your stuff out of here. Move in my bedroom.

Doesn't work anyway.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : No, of course it doesn't work, because after Angel stole it there was a disenchanting ceremony. It took half the meeting. How did you get this?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : It was my payment.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Your payment? What are you talking about?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : What do you <i>  think </i> I'm talking about, Lindsey?</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : I don't know! <i>  [She just looks at him and after a beat he turns away. Stares down at the ring then back at her with a frown.] </i> What happened?</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : Nothing. Nothing happened. My god, nothing at all.</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Tell me. I have to know.</dd><dd> <b>  Darla </b> : You want details, Lindsey? Is that what you want?</dd><dd> <b>  Lindsey </b> : Yes. I want details. I need to know everything. All of it. What did he do to you?</dd></dl>

Sorry. I thought it would help with the cravings.</dd><dd> <i>  [Rips a page out of the book Wesley was looking at earlier and spits her gum into it.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Harmony </b> : I mean, you'd think I'd get a thank you for not biting any of you.</dd><dd> <i>  [Wesley snatches the crumpled page from her.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : *What* are you doing!?!

Season 2
Dead End
<dl><dd> <b>  Nathan </b> : These re-evaluations are always a bit of a mixed blessing. Sad as we lose one of our own, but also hopeful as we turn towards the future and promote one of our own.

If I'd been in your shoes, I would've chosen Lilah. Let me tell you why. Do you have any idea of the hours this chick has logged in? Huh? The files she has on you guys? Deep stuff. Ronnie, your stock manipulations; Nathan's little offshore accounts. Can you imagine if something were to happen to this girl, and those files got back to the Senior Partners? They'd eat you alive! She's been working overtime, boys. She's everything you ever dreamed of. Lilah is your guy. Me, I'm unreliable; I've got these evil hand issues. And I'm bored with this crap. And besides, I'm leaving, so if you wanna chase me, be my guest. But remember- <i>  [holds up his hand] </i> evil.

That Vision Thing
<dl><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : I'm right as rain.</dd><dd> <b>  Fred </b> : I never understood that saying-right as rain. How is rain right? Or wrong for that matter? Okay, I suppose if there's a flood it's wrong, and speaking of floods, or just being overwhelmed, what's it like to have a vision?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Wow.

Season 3
That Vision Thing
<dl><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : The Host reads people's auras to set them on their path, in some shape or form that connects them to the Powers that Be.

That he might be able to use Cordelia in order to 'trace the call' back to the Powers.</dd><dd> <b>  Lorne </b> : WAY outside my area of expertise, I should caution.

I don't switch sides whenever it gets tough. And since when is this your job? I thought Angel was the Dark Revenger.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Angel feels responsible for this guy because he brought him back from hell. I feel responsible because he did it to save me. You, who are actually responsible for the entire thing, feel nothing at all, because you are a vicious bitch.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilah </b> : So you know me.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : Please, I was you.

Some lose their mind in an instant. Others, can take hours. Gee, I sure hope Angel isn't starting to feel testy.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : You better hope it.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilah </b> : I know. I've seen his dark side.</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : You really haven't. <i>  (Lilah looks nervous) </i> I have to find Billy.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilah </b> : And I'm going to help you why?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : You know that guy you hired to hack into my visions? What he did to me? You know what it felt like? I was cut, torn up, my face disfigured and burning with pain every second, not knowing if it was going to end or just get worse until I died.</dd><dd> <b>  Lilah </b> : So you think I owe you?</dd><dd> <b>  Cordelia </b> : It's not the pain. It's the helplessness. The certainty that there is nothing you can do to stop it. That your life can be thrown away in an instant by someone else. He doesn't care. He'll beat you down until you stay down, because he doesn't even think of you as alive. No woman should ever have to go through that, and no woman strong enough to hold the mantle of vicious bitch would ever put up with it. Where is Billy going?</dd></dl>

You want Sahjhan. Nowadays you can walk right through them, but in the past they were something else. They were all about torture and death. You can relate. Well, they caused a lot of trouble. Don't get me wrong. I like trouble. But I don't like chaos. So we changed them.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You made them immaterial.</dd><dd> <b>  White Room Girl </b> : Smart boy.

I just wanted you to know I understand that. And I also wanted to say I thought what Angel tried to do to you was wrong. And I'm sorry. But he was right to blame you, Wesley.

It's all I've got.</dd><dd> <i>  [Angel stands still, looking straight ahead, not at Holtz.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Holtz </b> : Not all. You had a son. So there it is. I thought by depriving you of that son it would allow me some measure of justice. I was wrong.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Taking Connor from me was never justice. It was vengeance.</dd><dd> <b>  Holtz </b> : Or maybe vengeance is what I do now. Give back what I took.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Holtz </b> : I'm an old man now. I have nothing to offer the boy. You can give him what I can't: his purpose. But every time you look upon his face every time he calls you 'father' you will be reminded of that which you took and can never give back. And if that is vengeance, I find I have no taste for it. <i>  [He picks up the letter and holds it out to Angel.] </i> All I ask is that you give him this. It's not sealed. I expect you'll examine it. You should.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Why are you doing this.</dd><dd> <b>  Holtz </b> : I thought I'd made that plain. I love my son.

<dl><dd> <b>  Holtz </b> : <i>  [voiceover] </i> Dearest Stephen, this is a most difficult letter for me to write. You mean more to me than anything in this world or any other. But your best interests must come first, which is why by the time you receive this, I will be gone. I hope one day you will be able to forgive an old man's weakness, which compels him to say these things in a letter. But to attempt a good-bye in your presence would be impossible for me. I fear I would never let you go. And I must let you go. I know that if I didn't you would only end up hating me. And that I could not bear. Your destiny lies with Angel. I know that now. You will have a better life with him. I'm comforted by that certainty and the knowledge that with him you will discover your true purpose and come to know who it is you are meant to be. My only prayer is that I have prepared you well enough for whatever lies ahead. I trust that I have. Be brave. Lovingly, your father.</dd></dl>

OK, I'll play.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Is it a game?</dd><dd> <b>  Angelus </b> : Hey, open book. Anything you want to know. How sweet that virgin gypsy tasted.

And two, if I did have any friends, they sure as hell wouldn't be living inside my head.</dd><dd> <b>  Beastmaster </b> : Like you're forced to live inside Angel's? Because you're the voice in there, aren't you? Just beneath the surface, buried under all that goodness, fully conscious, fully aware, but trapped.

Season 4
Peace Out
<dl><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : It was a trial run, an early experiment to work out the bugs, so to speak. I won't make that mistake again. I know where Angel is, and I know what he's looking for. He's wasting his time.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : If you really believed that, you'd have killed us already.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Peace Out
<dl><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Too much trouble conquering a primitive dimension, wasn't it, Jasmine? Or whatever your name is. Must be nice for you that we have satellites to beam your message to the rest of the world.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : You're not wrong.</dd></dl>
Season 4
Peace Out
<dl><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Connor, what does Jasmine eat?</dd><dd> <b>  Connor </b> : What?</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : The creature in the sewer. It called her the devourer. Devourer of what?</dd><dd> <b>  Connor </b> : I don't know.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : Don't You? The followers she randomly chooses to come to her room.

Peace Out
<dl><dd> <b>  High Priest </b> : What is it you think you fight for, dead thing? Valor? What you call justice? Your friends are dead. Most likely. Or so you believe. So it's not for them you fight.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : I'm trying to save my world!</dd><dd> <b>  High Priest </b> : Your world. A world that doesn't care for you.

<dl><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Jasmine, it's over. You've lost.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : I've lost? Do you have any idea what you've done?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : What I had to do.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : No. No, Angel. There are no absolutes. No right and wrong. Haven't you learned anything working for the Powers? There are only choices. I offered paradise. You chose this!</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Because I could. Because that's what you took away from us. Choice.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : And look what free will has gotten you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Hey, I didn't say we were smart. I said it's our right. It's what makes us human.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : But you're not human.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Working on it.</dd><dd> <i>  [Jasmine turns to walk away] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Where you going?</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : Leave me alone.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Sorry, but... can't do that.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : What? You've taken everything. You're gonna try to kill me now, as if you could.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Maybe not. But I'll die before I let you hurt anyone else.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : You're already dead!</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : You know what I mean. It ends right here.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : Why do you hate me so much?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Let's run down the list, huh? Rain of fire, blotting out the sun, enslaving mankind, and, yeah, oh, yeah, hey, you eat people!</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : Like you never have?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Thousands of people are dead because of what you've done.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : And how many will die because of you? I could've stopped it, Angel. All of it. War, disease, poverty. How many precious, beautiful lives would've been saved in a handful of years? Yes, I murdered thousands to save billions. This world is doomed to drown in its own blood now.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : The price was too high, Jasmine. Our fate has to be our own, or we're nothing.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : Like me?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Look, we've all done horrible things. All we can do is try and make up for it. So, OK, you know, it's not the world that you wanted, but maybe you can still help us make it better, even if you have lost your powers.</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : Not all of them.</dd><dd> <i>  [Jasmine punches Angel so hard that it sends him flying over the edge of the bridge.

Jasmine jumps off the bridge, lands on her feet, and walks menacingly toward Angel.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : Maybe you're right. Maybe I can still make this world a better place. One body at a time. I loved this world. I sacrificed everything I was to be with you.</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : So you could rule us?</dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : Because I cared. The other Powers don't. Never really did. You know that's true in your heart. Shame now I gotta rip it out.</dd><dd> <i>  [She reaches for Angel, but he grabs the end of the power line and electrocutes Jasmine with the live end. The electricity sends her back a few feet, but doesn't hurt her. She walks back toward Angel.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Jasmine </b> : I was forged in the inferno of creation, vampire. Do you really think a little electricity would destroy me?</dd><dd> <b>  Angel </b> : Worth a shot.</dd></dl>

She knew if you found out who she really was that you'd turn against her, and she was right. That's just what happened. People like you. People like this. None of you deserve what she could give you.

Now he's ours.</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : You went to a lot of trouble to get this staff. <i>  [Flash to Wesley's father pulling a gun out of the cyborg's body in the lab.] </i> You had us attacked, you smuggled in a weapon...you brought in an army so you could escape. I don't know why you're doing all this, but did you ever once consider there might be another way?

Why can't you trust that?</dd><dd> <b>  Roger </b> : You disgrace yourself with the council, you join forces with him, and you have the nerve to ask me why I can't trust you?</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : I've done everything you ever asked, and I've done it well.</dd><dd> <b>  Roger </b> : I asked for this, hmm? I wanted to be humiliated?</dd><dd> <b>  Wesley </b> : No, I suppose I don't know what you really wanted. You never had any use for me as a child, and you can't bear the thought of me as an adult. Tell me, father, what is it that galls you so? That I was never as good at the job as you... or that I just might be better?</dd><dd> <b>  Roger </b> : Oh, yes, this is Los Angeles.

Well, then... maybe if it's someone you care about...</dd><dd> <i>  [Roger turns his gun towards Fred, but Wesley shoots him without restraint.

He turns to look and sees his father's body fade into the body of a cyborg, shimmering with electricity. Wesley stares at it in disbelief.] </i></dd></dl>

I just opened up the door, and let the real you out.</dd><dd> <b>  Spike </b> : You never knew the real me.

You had a soul forced on you as a curse, make you suffer for all the horrible things you've done. But me, I fought for my soul, went throught the demon trials.
