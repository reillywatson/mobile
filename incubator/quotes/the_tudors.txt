Or were you just being cynical?</dd><dd> <b>  Princess Margaret </b> : I didn't see all of his game. Now I do. I despise him.</dd><dd> <b>  Charles Brandon </b> : So do I. But I hate Wolsey more. It's a marriage of expedience.</dd><dd> <b>  Princess Margaret </b> : Rather like ours.</dd><dd> <b>  Charles Brandon </b> : No, I loved you.</dd><dd> <b>  Princess Margaret </b> : You don't know the meaning of the word, Charles.

My lawyers have just advised me that to do otherwise might risk counter-suits. I could be seen to be acting against her conjugal rights.</dd><dd> <b>  Anne Boleyn </b> : You think it's nothing, to go back to bed with your wife?</dd><dd> <b>  King Henry </b> : What do you think is going to happen?</dd><dd> <b>  Anne Boleyn </b> : What usually happens.</dd></dl>

I call God and all the world to witness that I have been to you a true, humble and obedient wife, ever comfortable to your will and pleasure. I have loved all those who you have loved for your sake, whether or not I had cause, whether they be my friends or enemies. By me you have had many children, although it has pleased God to call them from this world. But when you had me at first, I take God as <i>  my </i> judge, I was a true maid without touch of man. And whether or not it be true, I put it to <i>  your </i> conscience. <i>  (She rises, curtsies to the King, and departs the court) </i></dd></dl>

Episode 1-10
<dl><dd> <b>  Knivert </b> : Aren't you supposed to be running the country?</dd><dd> <b>  Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk </b> : I leave that to Norfolk. He's had more practice.

They're all liars, hypocrites and middle-aged men.</dd><dd> <b>  Knivert </b> : Would you prefer them to be women?</dd><dd> <b>  Charles Brandon </b> : My friend, if all ambassadors were beautiful women I'd be serving my country day and night.</dd></dl>
