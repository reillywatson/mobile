Some tiny thing that might get you a reward and maybe spare you a few minutes of this. But then I keep forgetting, you're not human. You're a machine.</dd><dd> <b>  Leoben Conoy </b> : I am more than you could ever imagine. I am God.</dd><dd> <b>  Starbuck </b> : <i>  [stifles laugh] </i> I'm sorry, you're God? Wow... nice to meet ya. That's good, that's good. We'll give you a couple of minutes for that.</dd><dd> <b>  Leoben </b> : It's funny, isn't it? We're all God, Starbuck. All of us. I see the love that binds all living things together.</dd><dd> <b>  Starbuck </b> : Love? You don't even know what the word means.</dd><dd> <b>  Leoben </b> : I know that God loved you more than all other living creatures and you repaid His divine love with sin, with hate, corruption, evil. So then He decided to create the Cylons.</dd><dd> <b>  Starbuck </b> : The gods had nothing to do with it. We created you. Us. It was a stupid, frakked-up decision, and we have paid for it. You slaughtered my entire civilization. That is sin. That is evil. And you are evil.</dd><dd> <b>  Leoben </b> : Am I? I see the truths that float past you in the stream.</dd></dl>

You're afraid that we're a long way from home. What if you don't transfer all the way back? What if, when you die here, you really die? It's your chance to find out if you're really god or just a bunch of circuits with a bad haircut.</dd><dd> <b>  Leoben </b> : I'm not afraid of dying.</dd><dd> <b>  Starbuck </b> : Somebody's programmed you with a fairy tale of God and streams and life ever after but, somewhere in that hard drive that you call a brain is a beeping message: "Error, error, does not compute. I don't have a soul, I have software. If I die, I'm gone."</dd></dl>
Season 1
Flesh and Bone [1.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : Manipulative. Cunning. The only problem with Leoben isn't that he lies - that would be too easy - its that he mixes lies with truth.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Flesh and Bone [1.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leoben </b> : What is the most basic article of faith? This is not all that we are. The difference between you and me is, I know what that means and you don't.

Season 1
Flesh and Bone [1.08]
<dl><dd> <b>  Leoben </b> : I have a soul. I see patterns. I know you, you're damaged. You were born to a woman who believed that suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered. Your life is a testament to pain. Injuries. Accidents. Some inflicted upon others, others inflicted upon yourself. It surrounds you like a bubble. But it's not real, it's just... It's just something she put in your head. It's something that you want to believe because it means you're the problem, not the world that you live in. You want to believe it because it means that you're bad luck. You're like a cancer that needs to be removed. Because you hear her voice every day and you want her to be right.</dd></dl>

So... when do we begin?</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : Doctor Baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible, but there are some serious limitations, because he can only do one person at a time and verification takes hours.</dd><dd> <b>  Roslin </b> : So, who's going to go first?</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : <i>  [thinking for a second] </i> The test... right. I think people in sensitive positions should go first.</dd><dd> <b>  Roslin </b> : I completely agree. How about you?</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : Excuse me?</dd><dd> <b>  Roslin </b> : If you're a Cylon, I'd like to know.</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : If I'm a Cylon, you're really screwed. <i>  [Adama and Roslin both start laughing.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Roslin </b> : Seriously, I do think you should go first.

They slipped through. How's that possible?</dd><dd> <b>  Number Six </b> : She thinks she loves him now. That she can't live without him. Her passion is making her more resourceful.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Five </b> : It bothers you, doesn't it?</dd><dd> <b>  Number Six </b> : We'll get them in the end.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Five </b> : No, it bothers you that you've never experienced it.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Six </b> : You saw the way Helo was when we took her away. He was pathetic.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Five </b> : I can't help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely. Even in his anguish he seemed so alive.</dd></dl>

Season 2
Final Cut [2.08]
<dl><dd> <i>  [The closing voice-over narration to D'anna Biers' documentary on the Battlestar Galactica, which runs over a montage of images from the ship. The Colonial Anthem tinkles in the background and gradually builds to up to a grand swell.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Biers </b> : I came to Galactica to tell a story. In all honesty I thought I knew what that story was before I ever set foot there: how an arrogant military let their egos get in the way of doing their jobs, safeguarding the lives of the civilian population. But I found out that the truth was more complex than that. These people aren't Cylons. They're not robots blindly following orders and polishing their boots. They're people. Deeply flawed, yes, but deeply human too, and maybe that's saying the same thing. What struck me most is that despite it all - the hardships, the stress, the ever present danger of being killed - despite all that, they never give up. They never lie down in the road and let the truck run them over. They wake up in the morning, put on their uniforms and do their jobs. Every day. No pay, no rest, no hope of ever laying down the burden or letting someone else do the job. There are no relief troops coming, no Colonial Fleet training new recruits every day. The people on Galactica are it. They are the thin line of blue that separates us from the Cylons. Lt. Gaeta told me a remarkable statistic; not a single member of Galactica's crew has asked to resign, not one. Think about that. If you wore the uniform wouldn't you want to quit? To step aside and say "enough! Let someone else protect the fleet"? I know I would. But then, I don't wear a uniform. Most of us don't, most of us never will. The story of Galactica isn't that people make bad decisions under pressure, it's that those mistakes are the exception. Most of the time the men and women serving under Commander Adama get it right. The proof is that our fleet survives. And with Galactica at our side, we will endure. This is D'anna Biers, Fleet News Service.</dd></dl>

I say that knowing we've had our differences, and that you take office despite my many reservations. You may be the most brilliant person I've ever met... but your intelligence is unleavened by compassion. You must be reminded of your ethical responsibilities and challenged to rise above your own selfish needs. I don't write this to hurt you, but to beg you to open your heart. Understand that the people in the fleet look to you not just for leadership, but for solace, justice. Find a way to give them that, and you will be a great leader. Laura Roslin."</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Number One </b> : Let's review, why we're here shall we? Uh, we're supposed to bring the word of "God" to save the people right? To save humanity from damnation, by bringing the love of "god" these poor, benighted people.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Six </b> : We're here because the majority of the Cylons felt that the slaughter of mankind had been a mistake.</dd><dd> <b>  Boomer </b> : We're here to find a new way to live in peace.As god wants us to live.</dd><dd> <b>  Number One </b> : And it's been a fun ride so far. But I want to clarify our objectives. If we're bringing the word of "god" it follows that we should employ any means necessary to do so. Any means. Yes, fear, is a key article of faith as I understand it, so perhaps it's time to instill a little more fear into the people's hearts and minds. Let's uh, let's execute Baltar.</dd><dd> <b>  Baltar </b> : What? What?!</dd><dd> <b>  Number Six </b> : That's not gonna happen.</dd><dd> <b>  Number One </b> : Just because he's your favorite toy shouldn't interfere with the larger issues here.</dd><dd> <b>  Baltar </b> : I think that I have co-operated-</dd><dd> <b>  Number Six </b> : Gaius is with me. Anyone that wants to challenge that will have to deal with me.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Five </b> : Well it doesn't matter. If we killed him at the beginning, it might've worked. But now most humans think of him as a traitor, and might actually cheer his death.</dd><dd> <b>  Number One </b> : Fine, fine. We don't kill Baltar. We round up the leaders of the insurgency and we execute them, publicly. We round up at random, groups off the street and we execute them, publicly. Send a message that the gloves are coming off, the insurgency stops now or else we start reducing the human population to a more mangeable size. I don't know, say less than a thousand.</dd><dd> <b>  Boomer </b> : We need to stop being butchers.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Six </b> : The entire point of coming here was to start a new way of life.

Or would you raise your children with stories of the Cylon, the mechanical slaves who once did your bidding, only to turn against you? Killers who committed genocide against your race, the occupiers of this city until we just ran away? Would you tell them to tell the story to their children, and to their children's children, and nurse a dream of vengeance down through the years so that one day they could just go out into the stars and hunt the Cylon once more?</dd><dd> <b>  Gaius Baltar </b> : Blood for blood ...has to stop one day.</dd></dl>

Yet you bestow it with absolutes like, "There is no such thing as coincidence."</dd><dd> <b>  D'Anna/Number Three </b> : It's called faith.</dd><dd> <b>  Baltar </b> : Absolute belief in God's will means there's a reason for everything.

Sure he did, serious mistakes, but did he actually commit any crimes? Did he commit treason? No. It was an impossible situation. When the Cylons arrived what could he possibly do? What could anyone have done? I mean, ask yourself, what would you have done? What would you have done? If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons would've probably nuked the planet, right then and there. So did he appear to co-operate with the Cylons? Sure, so did hundreds of others. What's the difference between him and them? The President issued a blanket pardon. They were all forgiven, no questions asked. Colonel Tigh? Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers, killed dozens of people, forgiven. Lieutenant Agathon and chief Tyrol murdered an officer on the <i>  Pegasus </i> , forgiven. The admiral? The admiral instituted a military coup d'etat against the President, forgiven. And me? Well, where do I begin? I shot down a civilian passenger ship, the <i>  Olympic Carrier </i> , over a thousand people on board, forgiven. I raised my weapon to a superior officer, committed an act of mutiny, forgiven. And then on the very day when Baltar surrendered to those Cylons, I, as commander of <i>  Pegasus </i> , jumped away! I left everybody on that planet, alone, undefended for months. I even tried to persuade the admiral never to return, to abandon you all there for good. If I'd had my way nobody would have made it off that planet. I'm the coward, I'm the traitor, I'm forgiven. I'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes. We make our own laws now, our own justice, and we've been pretty creative with ways to let people off the hook. For everything from theft to murder. And we've had to be, because we're not a civilization anymore, we are a gang, and we're on the run, and we have to fight to survive. We have to break rules, we have to bend laws, we have to improvise! But not this time, no, not this time, not for Gaius Baltar. No, you, you have to die! You have to die, because, well, because we don't like you very much. Because you're arrogant, because you're weak, because you're a coward, and we, the mob, want to throw you out the airlock because you didn't stand up to the Cylons and get yourself killed in the process! That's justice now! You should've been killed back on New Caprica, but since you had the temerity to live, we're going to execute you now. That's justice!</dd><dd> [ <i>  crowd murmurs angrily </i> ]</dd><dd> <b>  Judge </b> : Order, order!</dd><dd> <b>  Lee </b> : This case, this case is built on emotion, on anger, bitterness, but most of all it's built on shame. It's about the shame of what we did to ourselves back on that planet. It's about the guilt of those of us who ran away, who ran away. And we are trying to dump all of that guilt and all that shame onto one man, and then flush him out the airlock, and just hope that that gets rid of it all. So that we can live with ourselves. But that won't work. That won't work. That's not justice, not to me. Not to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Lampkin </b> : No further questions.</dd></dl>

If you look inside yourself you will find that spark too. You will. But you have to look deep. Love your faults. Embrace them. If God embraces them, then how can they be faults? Love yourself. You have to love yourself. If we don't love ourselves, how can we love others? And when we know what we are, then we can find the truth out about others, seek what they are; the truth about them. And you know what the truth is? The truth about them? About you? About me? Do you? The truth is, we're all perfect. Just as we are. God only loves that which is perfect and he loves you.

I'd rather be wrong but we need insurance.</dd><dd> <b>  Number Two/Leoben </b> : Trust has to begin somewhere.</dd><dd> <b>  Natalie </b> : Not with us. It's our ship. When we jump, we take control of it with the Centurions. We carry out the mission as promised. But when we return, we take hostages. The humans on this ship will stay on this ship until we have the Five. We've changed but the humans haven't. We've come too far to risk everything on their trust.</dd></dl>

Hang onto hope in every hopelessly irrational way that we can, but not like those poor bastards, giving away their luck just when they need it most. Its like they've given up.</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : If you've never been in combat you have no idea what they are thinking.</dd><dd> <b>  Lampkin </b> : I always imagined you a realist, Admiral. Not one to indulge a vain hope at the cost of lives, but then everyone has his limits. Sine qua non as they say.</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : Without which not.</dd><dd> <b>  Lampkin </b> : Yes, those things we deem essential, without which we cannot bear living. Without which life in general loses its specific value. Becomes, abstract.</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : You may have a point counselor.</dd><dd> <b>  Lampkin </b> : Well, while I'm on a roll, Tom Zarek may not be an ideal president, but we could do worse.</dd><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : You're right, there are limits to my realism.

They wiped out most of humanity. Of course I didn't know that's what I was doing at the time. And when I realized what I had done, the magnitude, in that moment I was saved. I was loved, by God. Looking back, I think I was rewarded.</dd><dd> <b>  Roslin </b> : Rewarded?</dd><dd> <b>  Baltar </b> : Pythia talks about a flood. Wiped out most of humanity. Nobody blames the flood. Flood is a force of Nature. Through Flood mankind is rejuvenated, born again. I was another Flood. You see, I blamed myself. I blamed myself. But God made the man that made that choice. God made us all perfect. And in that thought, all my guilt flies away. Flies away like a bird.</dd></dl>

Turns out there's another kind of Cylon we didn't know about, and I'm one of them.</dd><dd> <b>  Adama: </b> <i>  (desperate) </i> On New Caprica, you were in captivity.

Without her our children are going to die off one by one, just like they're dying right now in Cottle's sickbay.</dd><dd> <b>  Tigh </b> : I had a child. He died.</dd><dd> <b>  Ellen </b> : You're wrong Saul. You have millions.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Adama </b> : No one should feel obligated to join this mission in any way. This is a decision I have made for myself.

Let there be no illusions; this is likely to be a one-way trip! So don't volunteer out of sentiment or emotion. There is a line running down this deck. Volunteers, move to the starboard side; Everyone else, to the port. Make your choice!</dd></dl>

She's a child and she holds the key to humanity's survival as well.</dd><dd> <b>  Cavil </b> : And how do you know that?</dd><dd> <b>  Baltar </b> : I see angels. Angels in this very room. Now I may be mad, but that doesn't mean that I am not right. Because there is another force at work here. There's always has been. It's undeniable. We've all experienced it. Everyone in this room has witnessed events that they can't fathom, let alone explain away by rational means. Puzzles, deciphered in prophecy. Dreams given to a chosen few. Our loved ones dead ... risen. Whether we want to call that God, or Gods, or some sublime inspiration, or a divine force that we can't know or understand, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. It's here, it exists, and our two destinies are entwined in its force.</dd><dd> <b>  Cavil </b> : If that were true, and that is a big if, how do I know that this force has our best interests in mind? How do you know that God is on your side, Doctor?</dd><dd> <b>  Baltar </b> : I don't. God is not on any one's side. God is a force of nature. Beyond good and evil. Good and evil, we created those. Want to break the cycle? Break the cycle of birth, death, re-birth, destruction, escape, death. That's in our hands. In our hands only. Requires a leap of faith. Requires that we live in hope, not fear.</dd><dd> <b>  Cavil </b> : If I give you this girl, that means the destruction of my people. How does our extinction fit into this picture that you want to believe in?</dd></dl>

Why the change of heart?</dd><dd> <b>  Virtual Six </b> : Mathematics. Law of averages. Let a complex system repeat itself long enough and eventually something surprising might occur. That, too, is in God's plan.</dd><dd> <b>  Virtual Baltar </b> : You know it doesn't like that name.</dd><dd> <i>  [Six gives Baltar a defiant look] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Virtual Baltar </b> : Silly me.
