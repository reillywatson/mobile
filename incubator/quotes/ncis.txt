That's what you weren't thinking! <i>  [begins pacing] </i> Although I suppose I could understand your initial reaction. You were at an emotional time for you and for people to act rationally -- but to tell Gibbs that you didn't trust Tony?! Which I guess I could also understand, because I guess he did just shoot your boyfriend. In your living room. To death. All right, I'll give you that one, but this is Tony we're talking about here! All soft and goofy on the outside and 100% rock on the inside! And after everything you accused him of, he risked his life to go save you! You should be ashamed of yourself, even though in hindsight it is starting to make a little bit more sense now. But either way, the ball is in your court! It is Tony one and Ziva zilch! This is your move, and it had better be a good one! Oh, God.

Just like it does not matter how it worked out for Michael.</dd><dd> <b>  Tony </b> : So what does?</dd><dd> <b>  Ziva </b> : That you had my back. That you have <i>  always </i> had my back. And that I was wrong to question your motives.</dd><dd> <b>  Tony </b> : So why did you?</dd><dd> <b>  Ziva </b> : I trusted my brother Ari. I trusted Michael. I could not afford to trust you.</dd><dd> <b>  Tony </b> : I thought you weren't sure what to say?</dd><dd> <b>  Ziva </b> : I guess I had a long time to think about things.</dd><dd> <b>  Tony </b> : I'm sorry, Ziva.</dd><dd> <b>  Ziva </b> : No. It is I who am sorry. <i>  [kisses Tony on the cheek] </i></dd></dl>

I volunteered to protect him, Gibbs!</dd><dd> <b>  Gibbs </b> : You lied to me.</dd><dd> <b>  Ziva </b> : No, when I told you Ari was innocent, I believed it! But yes, I would have lied to you. He was my brother and you were nothing. But I was wrong about Ari and you. When I pulled the trigger to save your life, I was not following orders.
