The thing you need to know is that Mara was innocent, and Jackson was innocent. They didn't know what they were drinking, and their last moments together were happy ones. They left the way I first found them, perfect and innocent. They were innocent; they're in heaven now, and we'll always be a family. <i>  [Pauses] </i> The guilty ones are me and Vic. Vic led, but I kept following. I don't think one's worse than the other, but we made each other into something worse than our individual selves. I wish I'd never met him. I see it all now, there's no apologies I can make, no explanations I can give. I was who I was, and I can't be that person anymore. I can't let myself..."</dd><dd> <i>  [Vic's expression has changed to show his distress.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Claudette: </b> We think this is where he was when we came in, because it stops there. All those busts...all those confessions you got in this room, illegal or otherwise...all the drugs you got off the street tonight for ICE...you must be very proud of yourself.</dd><dd> <i>  [Vic's expression is emotionless. He remains silent.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Claudette: </b> This is what the <i>  hero </i> left on his way out the door.</dd><dd> <i>  [Claudette produces the photos of Shane and his family.
