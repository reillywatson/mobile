It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed colors, she's just not paying attention. Oh, by the way, do you consume just ridiculous amounts of carrots and mega-dose vitamins? The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red.

<dl><dd> <b>  Rebecca Adler </b> : I just want to die with a little dignity.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're even born, but it always happens and there's never any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly - always! We can live with dignity - we can't die with it.</dd></dl>

Does it make a difference what I think? I'm a jerk. The only thing that matters is what you think. Can you do the job?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cameron </b> : You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy.

To think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty, not some genetic gift of intelligence?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cameron </b> : I worked very hard to get where I am.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : But you didn't have to. People choose the paths that grant them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That's the law of nature, and you defied it. That's why I hired you.

I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cuddy </b> : Short, sweet, grab a file.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : This ray of sunshine is Doctor Lisa Cuddy. Doctor Cuddy runs this whole hospital, so unfortunately she's much too busy to deal with you. I am a <i>  board </i> <i>  [emphasized to sound like "bored"] </i> ...certified diagnostician with a double specialty in infectious disease and nephrology. I am also the only doctor currently employed at this clinic who is forced to be here against his will.</dd><dd> <i>  [House turns to face Dr. Cuddy.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : That is true, isn't it?</dd><dd> <i>  [He turns back to the crowd.] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : But not to worry, because for most of you, this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin. Speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying, you may see me reach for this: this is Vicodin. It's mine. You can't have any. And no, I do not have a pain management problem, I have a pain problem. But who knows? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell. So, who wants me? <i>  [nobody moves] </i> And who would rather wait for one of the other two guys?</dd><dd> <i>  [Everybody raises their hands] </i></dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : Okay.

Season 1
Occam's Razor(1.03)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : What would you prefer - a doctor who holds your hand while you die or one who ignores you while you get better? I suppose it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Cameron </b> : I'm uncomfortable about sex.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Chase </b> : Well, we don't have to talk about this...</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cameron </b> : Sex <i>  could </i> kill you. Do you know what the human body goes through when you have sex? Pupils dilate, arteries constrict, core temperature rises, heart races, blood pressure skyrockets, respiration becomes rapid and shallow, the brain fires bursts of electrical impulses from nowhere to nowhere, and secretions spit out of every gland, and the muscles tense and spasm like you're lifting three times your body weight. It's violent, it's ugly and it's messy, and if God hadn't made it <i>  unbelievably </i> fun, the human race would have died out eons ago. <i>  [pause to breathe deep and stare at each other] </i> Men are lucky they can only have one orgasm.

Chase tells you that two people exchange fluids to create this being. I tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper. Are you going to go with the two or the one?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Foreman </b> : I think your argument is specious.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : I think your tie is ugly.</dd></dl>
Season 1
Occam's Razor(1.03)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : Why is one simpler than two? It's lower, it's lonelier, but is it simpler? Each one of these conditions is about a thousand to one shot; that means that any two of them happening at the same time is a million to one shot, Chase says the cardiac infection is a ten million to one shot which makes my idea ten times better than yours. <i>  [pause.

<dl><dd> <b>  Tattooed Walk-in Patient </b> : <i>  [turning to leave] </i> I should go.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : You think it's going to come out on its own? <i>  [the patient stops] </i> Are we talking bigger than a bread basket? Because, actually, it will come out on its own, which for small stuff is no problem - it's wrapped up in a nice soft package and plop. Big stuff - you're going to rip something, which, speaking medically, is when the fun stops.</dd><dd> <b>  Tattooed Walk-in Patient </b> : How did you--</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : You've been here half an hour and you haven't sat down, that tells me its location. You haven't told me what it is, that tells me it's humiliating. You have a little birdy carved under your arm, and that tells me you have a high tolerance for humiliation, so I'm figuring it's not hemorrhoids. <i>  [pause for awkward silence] </i> I've been a doctor twenty years. You're not going to surprise me.</dd><dd> <b>  Tattooed Walk-in Patient </b> : It's an MP3 player .</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : <i>  [trying to keep himself from laughing] </i> Hmm.

It's 3 o'clock, I'm off. Could you tell Dr. Cuddy there's a patient in exam room 2 that needs her attention? And the RIAA wants her to check for illegal downloads.</dd></dl>

Season 1
Maternity(1.04)

Well, got your Levaquin. Antibacterial soaps in every bathroom. We'll be adding vancomycin to the water supply soon. We bred these superbugs. They're our babies.

No, everyone in Africa's got cell phones or running water. <i>  [He has dropped Sebastian's cell phone in the toilet] </i> This thing just will not flush.</dd><dd> <b>  Sebastian </b> : Do you really think that if you come in here and make it a little hot, make it smell a little, that I'm just going to fold and abandon everything that matters to me?</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : <i>  [Wiping his cane on Sebastian's blanket] </i> Lousy sanitation over there, too.

Season 2
The Mistake(2.08)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. Chase </b> : <i>  [To Stacy] </i> Let's make a deal. I won't use the word "honestly," and you'll quit stopping by to see House so you don't take it out on me afterwards, how about that?</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Mistake(2.08)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : She's overreacting.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Wilson </b> : You snuck into her shrink's office and read her private file. When Nixon did that, he got impeached.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : So you're saying I'm not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either?</dd></dl>

Season 2
The Mistake(2.08)

He smiles all 84 of his teeth, tells them his tonsil story.</dd><dd> <b>  Stacy </b> : It's a nice story.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Foreman </b> : He still has his tonsils. As soon as he's out of the room, which is as soon as he can be out of the room, he starts in on the trash talk. Thinks not giving a crap makes him like House. Like something to aspire to.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Mistake(2.08)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : You know what's really killing her? Chase forgot to ask a standard question about stomach pain, so he missed the diagnosis, so she perforated, so she got sepsis, so her BP tanks, so she got blood clots, so she lost her liver. Livers are important, Cuddy. Can't live without them, hence the name. And here's the big issue: Chase is a hospital employee, and Kayla is the sympathetic mother of those two jury-friendly moppets Caleb and Cody.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Chase </b> : Dory and Nicky.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. Cuddy </b> : Your point, beyond just trying to make Chase wet himself, seems to be that the hospital faces liability here. Well, thanks for clearing that up. I still need a medical reason to list her.</dd><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : That is a medical reason! The family wins this hospital in a lawsuit, they'll turn it into condos. And people will die waiting outside a condo for medical care.</dd></dl>
Season 2
The Mistake(2.08)
<dl><dd> <b>  Dr. House </b> : The hospital lawyer asks me if I did something unethical. If I did, the last person I tell is the hospital lawyer, especially since she's gone all Old Testament on me.</dd></dl>
